793,10794,United Airlines,14-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"After a 20 min delay during the first part of our trip we arrived in Charlotte only to be told we had to race across the entirety of the airport in less that 15 mins (which would have been feasible if we had the full 35+ mins). We managed to reach the gate 6 mins prior to the 'last' boarding call but they had ""closed the doors for an early departure"" and refused to allow my wife and I onto the plane. They then directed us to go all the way back across the Airport to get lower quality and separate seats on a much later flight. They attempted no form of compensation or even an apology and acted as if it were our fault and that they were doing us a favor by 'allowing' us to get the terrible seats. The worst of it though is their claim to be both Military and Handicap friendly but they fail in both.",sad
794,10795,United Airlines,14-Jun-14,USA,3,Economy,3,NO,Plane looked extremely old and worn. Food was poor even by airline standards. Inflight entertainment consistent of overhead screens with 80's image quality. Can't remember when I last sat in a plane with such prehistoric inflight entertainment. The worst were the stewardesses. Not all of them. But some of them were really unfriendly. The highest level of service that one older grumpy stewardess could muster during a 10 hour flight was to tell me that I had been standing at the back of the plane for too long (I was reading a book standing up couldn't bear sitting in the seat anymore) and I needed to sit down. Probably the least service-centred flight I ever experienced. United Airlines is an airline that I will use in the future only when I can't afford the alternatives.,sad
795,10796,United Airlines,14-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,5,NO,Flew from Okinawa Japan with final destination at D.C. Dulles (IAD) with stops at Narita (NRT)-Tokyo and Chicago O'Hare-ORD. Flight from Okinawa to Tokyo is always through ANA since United contracts them out to and from Tokyo to Okinawa. I then flew a 747 Economy Plus from NRT to ORD. Waste of money to upgrade to Economy Plus. A little more leg room and width but that is it. Food and drink service was the same (not much) so can't recommend this. No personal entertainment (was all on the big screen). Food was not good and seems to be deteriorating no longer do they give you any fruit or vegetables but just one course meal and that is it. I also noticed they now charge you for a beer or wine I think they just changed this as of January 2014? I paid an embarrassing $6 for a Heineken which I thought used to be included for Economy Plus? Service was just ok and nothing special. I then flew from ORD to IAD and again Economy Plus but waste of money. Seats felt tight and cramped and I noticed absolutely no under the seat room for bags or stretching out? Onboard departure was chaotic as people couldn't store their luggage in overhead bins.,sad
796,10797,United Airlines,13-Jun-14,UK,1,Economy,4,NO,"Flight on April 22 2014 was delayed and then cancelled. After sitting and being told the takeoff was being delayed 3x they finally cancelled the flight. Announcing casually that it was cancelled and everyone needed to go to Customer Service. No warning. No ""We are really sorry."" No approaching the customer to help us out.",sad
797,10798,United Airlines,13-Jun-14,UK,5,Economy,4,NO,I've had an awful experience both times I've flown with United. The first time all my flights were over booked and delayed. (Two flights there and back due to connections.) They gave us very little information about why and were extremely pushy when finally getting us to board the plane. We spent a long time sitting in the plane after being boarded with no explanation before we finally took off. They offered compensation to take a later flight but I had already been delayed for 2+ hours! On the more recent flight the flight was overbooked and I was unable to get on. There were no other flights out of YYC to SEA and I ended up having to cancel my trip. They have not been helpful when I tried to contact them. They told me they were transferring me to International Customer Service but I was just disconnected! I would not recommend United. Avoid them if you can!,normal
798,10799,United Airlines,13-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,I can honestly say this was the worst trip I have had in 20 years. Seat allocation is by far the worst especially if you are travelling with children. Chances of getting seats together are slim. My 11 year old wasn't even allocated a seat regardless how many times we tried online prior to flying and we booked last June. After a lot of stress got a seat but not together. They over book all flights and offer people compensation if they take another flight. Or offer you an upgrade to get all seats together as they tried with us for an extraŁŁ80 each. As someone said to us on the flight was that they are only after money. As regards to check in at Heathrow. What a mess. All electronic to get boarding passes. It was like a bun fight. United make a big thing about there new systems and app but have forgotten the most important thing. The customer. Luggage. Make sure each bag is under weight. As they don't take into account overall weight. Tried to charge us Ł150 for 1 bag over by 2 lbs. We transferred it to a lighter bag. As I said before only interested in the money. They could learn a thing or too from EasyJet as regards to seating. The food was good is the only positive experience. I would never use again.,sad
799,10800,United Airlines,13-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,4,NO,I am sitting in First EWR-LHR so can't complain too much but I'm shocked at how a global first customer is treated. First I had to argue with the gate agent at the entrance to the global first/global services lobby who said I was not allowed in. I pointed out that I was flying global first 3 times and then demanded that we ask the people inside who said I was of course welcome. After heading into the lounge which at EWR is only a United club not first I went to the gate which was chaotic. They called global services group 1 and I came in behind the one GS person in group 1. I was actually pulled out of line and held back because they said only global services. I asked about global first and group 1 which was being called and was promptly told first class is very different from global services. I know now why I usually just take Lufthansa and connect through Germany for their grace and ease. It is amply clear that we million miler 1k fliers just aren't worth much at united. Why bother being loyal.,sad
800,10801,United Airlines,11-Jun-14,USA,10,Economy,3,YES,My flight out of Austin to San Francisco was delayed over an hour which caused me to miss my next flight. That flight was the last one out of SF for the night. The 3 people at the counter in Austin told me bluntly that there would be no compensation for the fact that I was going to stay the night sleeping in the terminal in SF. When I arrived in SF I went to the counter in Terminal 1 looking to get my boarding pass for the next day. I was handed hotel and food vouchers. I use United because they're the only carrier out of my smallish town (Chico CA) and before getting that voucher I had promised myself never to use United and to drive the almost 2 hours to Sacramento to use another carrier.,happy
801,10802,United Airlines,11-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,1,YES,My first trip to Asia IAD-SFO-ICN (Seoul Incheon) and back. A319 from IAD to SFO was small first class seats were old and not great. FA's were good food was OK Flew global first on a 747 to Seoul. Toilets stopped working half way through the flight and we landed in Osaka for repairs. Delayed my trip by two hours but the crew handled it well. Return flights was upstairs in business first seat was narrow but not bad IFE was good food was also good. SFO to IAD on a 757-200 that had to be 25 years old with CRT IFE from 1990. FA's were excellent but the plane needs to be retired. Overall a good trip and I truly think once United modernizes its fleet it needs to decide if it wants to compete with the foreign carriers. If so maybe a few less seats in business class get away from 2-4-2 configuration and perhaps better first class seating in the domestic fleet.,sad
802,10803,United Airlines,9-Jun-14,Italy,1,First Class,0,NO,I fly with United because it is one the few alternatives to fly directly to Bogota. They do not respect the seat assignments. On 2 occasions they changed without explanation even though I had paid for economy plus set they sent me to the back I had to really fight to get one in economy plus. On a 5 hour international flight they give you nothing just a drink. No entertainment.,sad
803,10804,United Airlines,9-Jun-14,UK,1,Economy,4,NO,"I flew First Class on UA14 HNL-EWR. The plane was clean and the entertainment system was excellent. The food however was inedible. What they called ""chicken cacciatore"" was really a piece of cardboard. I have had better food in Coach on other airlines. Service on the flight was de minimus. The flight crew seemed only interested in finishing the pitiful dinner service as quickly as possible. Nobody flies for the food but United sets the bar for the worst food and catering in the industry. I thought Delta had poor food (which they do) but by comparison they look pretty good.",sad
804,10805,United Airlines,9-Jun-14,USA,3,Economy,1,NO,As a long time Continental customer and I really am trying to like United but they sure make it difficult. This is supposed to be an American company but they outsource customer service to India and Philippines with poor service to us customers. My flight from Narita to Newark Liberty was on a 777 that needs repairs and a good cleaning. My seat controls weren't working properly and the lavatories were dirty. Absolutely no amenities in the lavatories. I asked the flight staff for some soap and she gave me her own bacteria spray! For the cost of a business class ticket on this international flight you would think that United would provide what is standard on other airlines. The food was mediocre and no longer worthy of a business first pricing. All my other flights to Asia and around Asia were with Asiana and Bangkok Air. Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines. I took several 45 minute flights on Bangkok Air and would you believe they provided box breakfast/lunch with soft drink on each flight at no extra charge. And served and cleaned up over 100 passengers within the 45 minutes. It takes that long to get one drink sometimes with United.,sad
805,10806,United Airlines,9-Jun-14,Qatar,8,Economy,1,YES,LAX-NRT-LAX (en-route to BKK) BizFirst on UA's new 787. Service both directions was really top notch. The crew were professional and attentive and on both legs the International Service Co-ordinator came to personally thank each passenger for their business and for choosing United (I thought that added a very nice touch). Meals were actually quite good and the wine parings worked well. Opted for the Japanese meal on the return and found it pleasantly delicious (including the array of sushi appetizers). The best thing about the trip was the aircraft. Arrived refreshed and didn't feel like I'd spent 12 hours in an airplane upon landing. Would recommend flying the a/c wherever possible. Overall high marks for this flight.,happy
806,10807,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,5,NO,Orange County-SFO Round Trip - April 2014. Be aware: paying extra for an Economy Plus gives you the privilege to board last (group 5). On a full plane it means that the overhead bins will be full when you embark and you will be deny boarding with your carry-ons. They will be checked at the gate of the aircraft. It happened to us on both legs of this trip even though our carry-ons were undersized and we had only one per person other than my wife's purse and my computer shoulder bag. But for our surcharge we had a free half glass of water served by stern attendants. What a bargain! Too bad Virgin America no longer flies out of SNA. I really miss them. Their service is light years ahead of United. And when you pay a premium for a Virgin seat you have real perks coming with it. Not bait and deceit.,sad
807,10808,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,Most excruciating flight I have endured was the 757 UA flight from Newark to Oslo on 5 April. The seats in economy were sadistically cramped. The aisle was so narrow that the crew could not move their carts without repeatedly banging and bumping into passenger seats. United's utter contempt for its customers and its crews is all too evident in its creation of such a tortuous experience. United has finally jumped the shark in the cheap cheesy penny-pinching department. I can choose to fly another airline and believe me I will.,sad
808,10809,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,UK,2,Economy,1,NO,"This was our worst experience. United Airlines had already been the airline with the most customer complaints and proved to be true when we took a trip to Florida. On the way back our flight for 3pm had been delayed for 5pm and then was cancelled due to ""maintenance issues."" We took another flight for 8pm and again was delayed to 9.30pm. We asked the lady at the counter and she said that the cabin crew wasn't prepared for travel so they delayed the flight. They are disorganized and I will never be flying United again.",sad
809,10810,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,UK,2,Economy,5,YES,United Express: I flew from ORD to ASE in March and although they have us over a barrel as they are the only airline with non- stops the flight wasn't bad. We had to cram into a little regional jet definitely much smaller than United's traditional mainline aircraft but it was a relatively new plane. The seats did seem smaller but the service was jut about the same as its big brother. The fare was on the high side though.,sad
810,10811,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,Ireland,7,Economy,2,YES,"I have flown from Newark to Delhi or Mumbai multiple times. The routing works well for me as I can access EWR from Philadelphia easily with the Amtrak codeshare although since they require more than a 3 hour layover in EWR on the way back the codeshare is only useful outbound. I like the Economy Plus seating which is a plus for the long trip. Despite being at the top Premier level however I find that I never get upgraded to business class despite supposedly having ""System-wide upgrades"" available. In practice these can never be used on these flights in my experience and one has to pay extra to be ""eligible"" then does not get the upgrade anyway. I am trying to book a ticket now and even though 38/40 business class seats are empty they will not confirm the upgrade and from what one reads on the internet the only way to get it is to check again and again and again and perhaps you might get lucky when they have opened one. In general the ""free upgrade"" offer for international travel seems to be a scam. The economy plus seating is better than normal economy though although I'm not sure it compares favorably with other airlines' economy.",normal
811,10812,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,4,Economy,3,NO,HNL to BKK. Aborted take off in HNL. Plane back to ramp sit inside plane for 5 hours. Problem could not be fixed mechanical. Flight cancelled. Told to disembark get out luggage at Arrivals and go to Departure area to rebook. This on a 747 with 350 plus people on it - all pulling their luggage about 1/2 mile to Departure area. Line up at departure area United to re-book - wait 7 hours to get to counter. Only 2 staff members to rebook the entire airplane. I was put on Delta the next day to NRT. Gave me $10 voucher for meals and over night free stay in Waikiki hotel. Cheapest meal at hotel was $18. Next AM Delta took off on time got me to TKO then transfer to United back to BKK. Never again with United!,normal
812,10813,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,I flew from DCA-EWR on Monday April 14. It was a mess United cancelled all of its flight out of DC without any reason. The weather was perfect my flight was suppose to be at 11.30am they cancelled it then I was put on the 4.30pm which was delayed and finally at 6.30pm they decided to cancel. They don't think of their passengers they don't respect their time this airline is really the worst airline I've ever flown. Would not recommend.,sad
813,10814,United Airlines,5-Jun-14,UK,7,Business,5,NO,London Heathrow-Chicago O'Hare UA0929. Chicago OHare Intl-Denver UA1014 29th May 2013. Denver-Rapid City UA4914. Rapid City-Chicago OHare UA4414. Chicago OHare-London Heathrow UK. UA0938 23rd June 2013. I cannot understand United are not upping their care for its customers. We flew with United on our last holiday and quite honestly never again. We have flown to many places around the world and United without any doubt are the worst airline I have used. The cabin crew are lazy and somewhat rude doing as little as they can. They could not even ask for the window blinds to be raised when coming in to land at London Heathrow. They did a standard talk when we were on the plane (with a special welcome to our premium and military customers). So quite obviously the economy passengers do not matter remembering of course that it is economy passengers that are the bulk of their customers.,normal
814,10815,United Airlines,5-Jun-14,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,We flew from LAX to Dublin Ireland. I will never fly United again. The plane looked old it was also dirty. The drink service took forever! I realized it was because when you order a soda they don't give you a cup of ice and the can anymore. No. They now open a can a pour some into the cup for you and then use the same can for the next passenger. I've never had an airline do this. Very cheap. The worst part was the food. I am a vegetarian. When I booked the flight and went online to request a vegetarian option the only option I saw was Indian food. I highly dislike Indian food so I thought this was odd. I called customer service to inquire about other vegetarian options. They have no satisfactory options for vegetarians. I told her I would stick with the regular meal instead my plan was to eat the sides. When the meal service came around they brought me the Indian vegan plate! I told them that I did not request this and asked for a regular meal. They said they did not have enough and maybe once they served everyone if there was an extra I could have it. I didn't eat on the way to Ireland. On the way back I had to make sure to bring food for me to eat on the plane. Both flights to and from were delayed by 2+ hours.,sad
815,10816,United Airlines,5-Jun-14,USA,7,Business,2,NO,"I recently was on a United flight from DFW to ORD with my two small children (3 years and 10 months). After takeoff it became necessary for me to change my daughter's diaper. I pressed the flight attendant button and told the man that I needed to utilize the restroom with my daughter but since the lavatory was so small it was impossible to bring my 3 year old son with me. I asked if he could keep an eye on him just to ensure he stayed seated. I was told very tersely that this was not his job and he couldn't possibly do such a thing. I tried contacting United and got the following response ""The flight attendants are not required to assist with these type of activities it is strictly up to the flight attendants."" If you offer no assistance for people traveling alone with multiple children perhaps you should make your customers aware of your flight attendants utter uselessness before they board a plane assuming they will be treated as valued customers.",normal
816,10817,United Airlines,4-Jun-14,Poland,10,Economy,3,YES,"SFO-LAX and LAX-LHR - in the recent past this airline has made my no-fly list for being unreliable to the point of fitting the description of ""not fit for purpose"" so I was reluctant to use them on this routing but had no choice as it was part of a Star Alliance mileage redemption. In fact both flights were easy to check in with no surprises boarded in an orderly way pushed early the crew were friendly the meal on the 777 from LA to London was tasty the entertainment options on the 777 were diverse and well chosen (and no tedious pre-roll ads before the movies) and my bags were on the carousel promptly. Couldn't ask for more so they're off my no-fly list and fingers crossed for a few more flights like this. All we need now is to get rid of the ghastly 90s photoshop globe with the wonky perspective and bring back the Saul Bass tulip.",happy
817,10818,United Airlines,3-Jun-14,Russia,10,Economy,4,NO,First time when we used united airlines international connecting flight in San Francisco we notice their system are very disorganised in their terminal no one to help and most staff are not helpful. On another experience coming back from LAX going back to Sydney the staff at check were the same - all unhelpful. All they did was stand and talk among themselves.,happy
818,10819,United Airlines,30-May-14,UK,7,Premium,4,NO,United Airlines was a disaster to travel through and not worth the amount of stress they cause all of their passengers. I was on a 7 hour flight and they had all movies and shows on repeat. The staff were very unhelpful. My flight ended up getting cancelled and I got re-routed to a much longer flight pattern. There were others I could have taken but United were SO unhelpful that I didn't find out until after the flight. The people there have no idea what they're doing. I was a day late for an important meeting. I received nothing in return for the inconvenience.,normal
819,10820,United Airlines,29-May-14,USA,1,Economy,3,YES,SAN-IAH-AMS LHR-LAX-SAN in economy plus. Planes were clean service was professional and pleasant food decent IFE was very good and my baggage arrived with me. One flight segment IAH-AMS was 40 minutes late departing but arrived on time thanks to strong tailwinds. No complaints.,sad
820,10821,United Airlines,29-May-14,USA,5,Business,1,NO,We were on the last leg of our trip at Denver Airport when out flight had been delayed 5 times. After the fifth time they changed out gate assignment and again the flight was delayed twice. After waiting until almost all other flights from the airport were gone for the night our flight was canceled. We were sent to customer service where things were even worse. Told we would have to stay in Denver until late the next day or even until 2 days from then. I was able to find flights the next day on many other airlines but they would not allow. We then decided to driver home from Denver Co to Madison WI (15 hours) with two young kids. The customer service lady gave us some vouchers for the food stores in the airport but the stores would not accept these vouchers. I will pay great amounts of money and drive hours to other airports to never use this airline again.,normal
821,10822,United Airlines,28-May-14,Netherlands,8,Economy,2,NO,United overbooked my flight. They asked me to take a later flight to Hawaii when I refused they changed my flight anyway which gave me a five hour wait at the SF airport. They offered nothing for this inconvenience and acted as if they were doing me a favor. This was my first and last trip on United.,happy
822,10823,United Airlines,28-May-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Very disappointed with my experience with United on Feb 2014. Had a first flight that was oversold we couldn't get on the plane. Had to be re-routed and got 3 flights instead of 2 originally scheduled to arrive at 9 pm instead of 4.30 pm to destination. We found out prior to our last flight that we had not been properly booked into the flight had to be changed to another flight again after an hour of waiting at the understaffed customer service desk. At destination now trying to confirm our seats for the return flight. It's been cancelled! We've tried to call customer service after a 20 minutes wait we're told that we need to be transferred to international flight dept. Another 20 minute wait. Another transfer. We ended up waiting 2hours. Very poor service.,sad
823,10824,United Airlines,28-May-14,USA,5,Economy,5,NO,I recently flew First Class on United # 15 from Newark to Honolulu. This is a 10+ hour non stop flight. The plane leaves at 9:20 am in the morning. The 767-400 was recently updated with the new sleeper seats. The plane was clean and very comfortable. The entertainment system was excellent. The crew were efficient and nice. The really surprising disappointment was the food. A breakfast was served shortly after take-off but after that there was nothing except some doughy concoction that was served an hour before landing. The paucity of food and food service was stunning. Most other airlines serve Mai Tais on flights to Hawaii but not on United. I might as well have been on a flight to Cleveland. My advice to people traveling on United is to bring your own food even in First Class!,normal
824,10825,United Airlines,28-May-14,Canada,10,Business,1,YES,Flew SFO to PEK on 29th March in First and we had an exceptional crew. I'm not normally one to post positive reviews about United but they deserve this one. We found all flight attendants to be friendly eager to assist and they tried their best to meet all requests. The food was tasty and served at the appropriate temperature. It's still not exactly an elegant service but it's good.,happy
825,10826,United Airlines,27-May-14,USA,8,Economy,1,NO,"I was a loyal and frequent Continental flyer for a number of years. All airlines have problems and cause the passengers problems. Continental was not an exception. However I was generally pleased with the aircraft (the newest of fleets) and with service. I recall having been delayed at AUS on a trip to LHR via IAH with my wife. We arrived at IAH with only 3 minutes to spare. We were met with a cart and our passports were checked and tickets issued as we sped along. All that ended with the UAL merger. I got caught in FRA with the merger mess on ""the"" day and since then it has been a series of canceled and long delayed flights with missed connections and very old and ragged aircraft. Most recently I tried to fly AUS to LAX on a CRJ in First. The attendant grabbed my suit coat and started stuffing it in an overhead bin. I objected as I was to go straight into a meeting. Seems the closet had been removed for an additional rows of seats. We were delayed for de-icing then for a malfunctioning APU. Finally at the 2+ hour point we returned to the gate and I deplaned making an AA flight in time. I suspect this is my last UAL attempt. Too unreliable.",happy
826,10827,United Airlines,27-May-14,USA,2,Economy,4,NO,Second time in 25 days connection return flight layover +3 hours plus delayed takeoff by 3 hours out of O'Hare. This time there wasn't even any weather issues. Also both trips had cancellations and overbooking. Why bother paying for poor service when I can actually drive home faster.,sad
827,10828,United Airlines,26-May-14,USA,9,First Class,1,NO,I just returned from a flight from Chicago (ORD) to Tampa (TPA) for spring break. I made a reservation that was non-stop both to Florida and returning home. I'm handicapped and was traveling with my 7 yr. old grandson. The flight to Florida was fine leaving and arriving on time. The flight home was a different story my flight home was cancelled during the night and I was booked on a flight that left 40 min. earlier with a layover in NJ. for 2 hr. then another plane which we had to sit on for 30 min and leaving late. I called and explained why I needed a non stop flight I was told the only non stop plane wasn't leaving until 3 days later. This meant instead of a less the 3 hr flight it was a 7.5 hrs. I was unable to get any help from management customer service.,happy
828,10829,United Airlines,26-May-14,USA,2,Economy,5,YES,I flew from Heathrow to Charleston (SC) via Washington Dulles for vacation in late March. I flew UA123 which was a B757-200. This was an old plane but it had great AVOD and leg space and the staff were friendly. The flight was also early and very empty which is always a plus. The connections were typical subsidiary small airline service; nothing special nothing bad and on time. On my return from Washington our B777-2000 was delayed due to a fuel problem however the entertainment system was left on so we could finish our film. After a 45min delay the plane left and made up the time coming back across the Atlantic. This plane was half-empty and had been recently refurbished with a great AVOD system and spacious seating. Cabin crew were very helpful. I would definitely recommend United on the Heathrow - Washington route.,sad
829,10830,United Airlines,25-May-14,USA,1,First Class,2,NO,London Heathrow to Newark to connect to Fort Lauderdale Florida. My trip to Newark was uneventful. It was after landing in Newark that everything went wrong. Starting with the long immigration lines that wound around and around. My connection was scheduled to depart at 1.17pm and I was still at immigration at 1.10 even after enquiring about help from a United representative who was standing talking to a fellow colleague. She told me to join the line and when I ask what happened if I missed my connection she just tersely answered they will rebook you and walked away. At baggage claim there was no sign of my bag I was told to catch the flight and look for my bag in Fort Lauderdale. I finally got seated without a welcome or assistance from the two attendants standing at the door. We sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours. In the meantime however the empty seats started filling up little by little and I began to wonder if they were not just awaiting a fill to capacity flight. Not offered anything to eat. They gave us tea coffee or water and that was it. Needless to say that when I go to Fort Lauderdale my checked baggage was not there and was told it had been left in Newark and would be arriving on the 11pm flight. As I am writing this my baggage has still not been delivered.,sad
830,10831,United Airlines,25-May-14,USA,10,Business,1,NO,Narita Tokyo to Singapore Changi on March 28th. IFE did not work (and even if it did I would be stuck with according to what was in in-flight mag an old and poor quality selection) food awful and had to pay for wine on a transcontinental flight (a first for me). Whole flight experience a bit of a revelation for me as I am used to flying Asian and European carriers. It was a bit like flying a short-hop domestic flight in UK - nothing much really to keep you happy while you are stuck in your seat. Maybe UA treat international flights like their domestic US ones. Even the announcements were the worst I have come across. Purser who did not seem to be able to speak English and a captain who had obviously not been sent on any course about speaking to the public (lacklustre disjointed and very rare). Won't be booking anything with UA again.,happy
831,10832,United Airlines,25-May-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Feb 2 from Newark to Punta Cana flight UA 1520 returned Feb 9 flight UA 1518. Traveled from Newark on March 21 flight UA 423 to Fort Myers. Returned on March 24 flight 1587. What a disappointment! It started at check-in at Newark airport they expect you to do everything and if you ask for help they make it seem they are doing you a huge favor. The seats are super tight have to pay for luggage food TV I'm surprised they don't charge to let you use the bathrooms! They make you feel like you are getting on a bus.,sad
832,10833,United Airlines,25-May-14,USA,1,Economy,2,YES,LAX-SFO-SEA-LAX in United First. Outbound legs to Seattle were great. Service was warm and personalized even if only snack basket and drinks were offered on these short runs. Where United really shined was on the return flight. Original SEA-LAX flight was canceled due to mechanical on inbound aircraft. I received a text message with this update and before I could even get to the agent UA had me rebooked on another carrier getting in just 30 minutes after my original UA routing. When I got up to the agent she had my ticket ready and waiting for me. I fly United almost every week and seldom have cancellations or major delays. Regardless the way they handled this one was flawless and I couldn't have asked for better service all-around.,sad
833,10834,United Airlines,24-May-14,USA,5,First Class,3,NO,"4 Sectors with United YVR-ORD ORD-BOS BOS IAH IAH-YVR. Very poor customer service on the ground and in the air. Greeted at the aircraft door by the usual icy scowl. A ""good morning"" from me totally ignored on all sectors. Officious cabin crew. A request for two drinks met by a terse response of ""We do more than one drink service this is United!"" Hugely oversized carry on bags allowed in the cabin. As a result the last few passengers to board are separated from their carry-ons and ordered to relinquish them even if they are of legal size. Purchased a roast beef sandwich on the 4.5 hour BOS-IAH leg it was tiny soggy and disgusting. On the 5 hour IAH-YVR sector departing at 2100 no hot items for purchase just snack boxes with cheese and crackers. I don't believe that United is any different to any other US airline these days. I can tolerate the ancillary charges the cramped seating the lack of food I understand that's what most of the budget conscience travelers demand these days. But simple manners courtesy and mutual respect cost nothing to provide and sadly they seem to be the most difficult qualities to find in any US airline.",normal
834,10835,United Airlines,24-May-14,Australia,6,Economy,2,NO,If there is any alternative to flying United take it. The staff do their best but everything about the interface is far from traveler-friendly. First of all the food - and this is in first class - can only be somebody's idea of comedy. Murky chalky flavors and strange un-natural textures characterized every dish I was given. Also on one recent Newark - Los Angeles flight there was were no screens in the plane - no movies no TV. No wireless available and no plugs.,normal
835,10836,United Airlines,22-May-14,USA,1,Premium,5,NO,Denver to Midland scheduled departure time was supposed to be 2.15pm. The flight was delayed 3 times and all while the plane was sitting at the boarding gate. The airline employee spike very broken English. Said that anyone traveling with children needed to be checked due to weight restrictions. She then said that 6 people needed to give up their seats for luggage of other travelers or she would not let the last people that checked in on the flight. No one volunteered so she picked 6 people 2 of which were military personnel. Once on the plane people were told to move seats to even out weight since. We will never fly with this airline again.,sad
836,10837,United Airlines,22-May-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,The worst experience I have encountered when flying. Total disregard to their customers and employees. The poor people at the gate were just beat up to no end and it was not their fault. Flew out of Aspen Colorado which only has 6 gates and 2-3 planes to manage and they could not even accomplish this simple management. United changed my flight without even giving me the courtesy of an e-mail or phone call to check to see if this arrangement was ok. It wasn't even a change in a flight on the same day but they changed the day I was flying out changed from one layover to two layovers changed the total flight time and did not even offer an apology for this inconvenience. In the future the only way I will ever fly United again is if there was no other airline going to this location. A horrible experience.,sad
837,10838,United Airlines,22-May-14,Canada,5,Economy,4,NO,I am on a flight to LAX from SFO already delayed by 45 mins waiting for flight crew to arrive. This had already given me a pretty good idea of customer service the flight's staff has to offer but that got solidified when I asked for 2 cups of water from one flight attendant and she told me - 'why don't you finish one first?'. She eventually got me another cup.,normal
838,10839,United Airlines,21-May-14,USA,7,Economy,2,NO,First international flight from MCO to HKG was great. Very smooth. Crew very helpful. Being on a 15+ hr flight hydration is important. All I had to do was take my water bottle to the back and the crew happily refilled it for me multiple times. They even came around with trays of cups with water every so often. Second flight back (HKG to MCO) was a disaster. First flight from HKG to Newark was delayed 2 hours. Not a big deal we still had time to make our connecting flight. However the plane was further delayed by another 1.5 hrs after we were already on it. The crew were extremely rude. After 6 hours of no water my husband asked if we could refill my water bottle same as the first flight but this time they looked at him like he was crazy and said they were about to bring the drink cart around so to just wait for that. By the time we finally touched down in Newark we missed our connecting flight so had to be put on one 4 hours later. Again that flight from Newark to MCO was delayed. Instead of leaving at 9pm as scheduled we took off from the runway at 11pm after waiting 2 hours on the plane. One of the bathrooms was not functioning properly. They made an announcement that they weren't going to fix the bathroom but had to fill out paperwork anyway so we'd be off the ground as soon as paperwork was finished. Next thing we know a guy is coming down the aisle and starts fixing the bathroom. Then we had to wait for him to fix it before we took off. In the meantime they let 5 more people on the flight so they had to play the safety video a second time before we could take off. Thankfully we had no problem getting our luggage. The movie selection available was also decent. Food was okay for the first two meals and the third was disgusting.,normal
839,10840,United Airlines,20-May-14,Australia,1,Business,5,NO,UA 861 from Washington to Rio de Janeiro scheduled to depart at 9.30pm. The flight was delayed first and then after making me wait for 5 hours the flight was finally cancelled due to mechanical problems at 3am. I got re- booked on the flight for the next day at the same time was given a night at hotel and $14 voucher for the meal for the whole day. The next day I found out that my connection to Sao Paulo to Rio no longer existed so was booked on a later flight with a regional airline. Basically what should've taken me 14 hours took me 48 hours. Furthermore my luggage arrived 2 days afterwards after several phone calls and different answers from United agents. The food served on the plane was inedible. Worst air travel experience. The seat was so crammed for a 9+ hour flight I had to buy premium economy on my way back so that my knees won't hurt.,sad
840,10841,United Airlines,19-May-14,USA,5,Business,1,NO,Absolutely the worst flight. Both trips were delayed for aircraft mechanical issues. 3 hrs on the way there 4 hrs on the way back. I've never really liked United but we still fly because we were avid Continental flyers for years. I will make it a personal goal to avoid United as an airline for any future flights I have. The price was ridiculous and the service and crew were mediocre at best. I thought United had newer aircraft fleet. Then why are two flights delayed because of mechanical issues? I would never recommend flying United.,normal
841,10842,United Airlines,18-May-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Milwaukee to Los Angeles March 16 2014 returned March 19 2014. Flight 5165. Flight 1273 missed this flight due to the above one being late next flight UA729. Return flight 1498 delayed and missed connecting flight 5438 rebooked to flight UA5425. Late flights and rude service. My flight leaving was late and missed connecting flight. On the return home my flight leaving and connecting flights were late. Flight attendant stands in aisle talking while we try to get off plane to make connecting flights. Captain had asked everyone to be seated unless you have a connecting flight.,sad
842,10843,United Airlines,18-May-14,UK,1,Economy,1,NO,"I booked a return trip to Las Vegas via Dublin. On the return trip the seat in front of me was an emergency exit. The seat itself appeared to be broken when the passenger in this seat put the seat in the rest position the seat reclined back so far that the space left to me was extremely confined. When I asked the cabin crew if I was obliged to have this person sitting ""on top"" of me she stated he was allowed to put his seat back. As a result I sat for 6 hours approx with no reasonable space in front of me. I got no food as there was no room to let down my food tray.",sad
843,10844,United Airlines,18-May-14,USA,6,Business,3,NO,Both coming from and going to our destination the check in staff were very rude and difficult to work with. We've always been around 50 pounds for our checked bags sometimes a little over sometimes less and most airlines don't care as long as you're close enough. Not United - it's 50 lbs exactly or they won't take your bags. Their check in staff are normally pretty unhappy and rude. What makes it even more ridiculous is most people just shift the weight to their carry-ons - meaning the airplane is still carrying the exact same amount of weight.,normal
844,10845,United Airlines,17-May-14,USA,4,Economy,1,NO,I recently flew from SFO to Cancun and back. First off I had to pay for poor entertainment offered inflight when other airlines offer better entertainment for free. I mean I paid for movies that I can't even pause when I use the restroom (ridiculous). Secondly no food was served for this long flight. Even some chips or light snacks would have helped. Thirdly the seats were meh I have had better seats. It is a forgettable experience except for the bad parts like the entertainment system. If given the chance I will not fly United again.,normal
845,10846,United Airlines,17-May-14,USA,6,Premium,1,YES,UA838 BKK-NRT Biz class. Flight was packed. Wonder why UA would discontinue BKK with the planed loaded with passengers. Laid flat seat. Sat on the upper deck near the cockpit. UA Biz were pretty crowded. Food was mediocre. Breakfast choices were Thai noodle or omelette. Grilled sandwich prior to landing was delicious.,normal
846,10847,United Airlines,17-May-14,UK,6,First Class,4,YES,UA79 EWR-NRT Biz-First. This is a long haul flight about 14 hours on a Boeing Dreamliner with staggered seats. Would have been nice for privacy but unfortunately seated next to a guy who had cold and sneezed around most of the time. Mid flight snack placed in the galley was minimum. When I went there most were gone. Toilet was poorly stocked with only 1 liquid soap bottle. Flight crews were nice. Amenity kit came in a lousy tin can but it is said to be a collectible one.,normal
847,10848,United Airlines,17-May-14,USA,8,Economy,5,YES,UA29 14/03/14. Friday evening departure from Newark and the airport was busy however the check in and bag drop facility was well organised so wasn't queuing long. Onboard the flight the 777 was full so it did feel quite claustrophobic the seats were not very comfortable but the legroom was ample. The flight only took 6 hours 15 minutes but the cabin crew were friendly and worked really hard and managed the meal service and two drinks runs before turning the lights off. Breakfast was served an hour and half before landing and consisted of a warm croissant and a small fruit salad. The flight landed ahead of schedule in to Heathrow and I was again fairly impressed with United.,happy
848,10849,United Airlines,17-May-14,USA,1,Business,4,NO,UA 468 SFO-PHX First Class. UA 1265 PHX-EWR First class. Typical domestic UA first which is nothing more than a bigger seat and free food. Ordered SW Chicken salad but got tasty beef with noodle instead. First class fare is not reasonable. If purchased separately way too expensive for what you get.,sad
849,10850,United Airlines,14-May-14,USA,1,Premium,4,YES,UA838 NRT-SFO Biz class. This is a long haul flight with amenity bag. Japanese food selection was Okay. Mid flight snack was placed quietly in a galley. Good thing was the arrival lounge at the SFO to freshen up and shower after landing. This lounge closed at noon and quite difficult to locate. It is on a lower level on the way to terminal 3 if you walk from the international terminal. Info desk did not know about the UA arrival lounge.,sad
850,10851,United Airlines,13-May-14,USA,7,Economy,1,YES,UA 837 NRT-BKK Biz. Sat on the upper deck to avoid the large Biz crowd. Flight was so packed. Hope UA consider to continue its operation to BKK again in the near future. Food was mediocre with beef steak. Japanese crews were polite and nice.,normal
851,10852,United Airlines,13-May-14,Canada,7,Economy,2,NO,March 12th 2014 flight UA200 was okay but we landed in Houston an hour late and were told our connecting flight UA5189 was cancelled. We were at Terminal B and at this point the service provided by United Airline Airport staff was very poor. Instead of providing us with a direct flight to Toronto we were put on 2 connecting flights these were delayed repeatedly until they were cancelled. We finally asked after waiting for 2 hours if there were any other flights to get home. We were put on an Air Canada flight to Toronto leaving at 2pm but told to go to terminal D to secure our seats and boarding passes but then were told to go to another Terminal and eventually found out this flight was leaving on March 13th a day later not 2pm on March 12th. Finally we went to counter 1 where a staff member helped fly us back to Toronto. We unfortunately had a 2nd overnight flight and although we left Honolulu on March 11th at 7pm we only landed into Toronto 6.45am Thur March 14th. The only saving grace was Air Canada offered free movies. We flew UA1715 and UA219 March 4 2014. Very long uncomfortable flight-no entertainment unless you paid. Very poor experience.,normal
852,10853,United Airlines,13-May-14,Switzerland,10,Business,1,YES,UA28 9/3/14. Noticed online that aircraft had been changed from 777 to a 767-400 which wasn't an issue as the 400s have AVOD entertainment similar to 777 and are far superior in comfort than the older 767-300. The service on this flight was good after the food service there was plenty of drinks runs and the cabin crew were happy to oblige when you went to galley for more. I only purchased one alcoholic drink on this flight as united charge $7 for a beer which in my view is a bit steep for a long haul flight but typical of an American carrier. Having flown with united before I knew what to expect and I wasn't disappointed and most importantly I got from a to b at a reasonable price.,happy
853,10854,United Airlines,13-May-14,USA,1,Business,3,NO,March 8th 2014 myself and 6 family members and friends were scheduled to fly at 3.15pm from Punta Cana to Newark. Of course the usual 45 minute delay in boarding was to be expected but by the time we got onto the tarmac and boarded the plane there was additional 2 hour delay. Finally by 9pm 6 hours after we were supposed to depart we were told the flight was canceled and would be rebooked the following day on flight 1762 at 2.20pm. Back through customs back to pickup up our luggage and then most of the passengers went onto a bus to a hotel to be returned the next day where the process was started again. 2 more hours to repeat check-in of luggage security and immigration. To add insult to injury United canceled another scheduled flight on Sunday and stranded 200 other customers so we could fly out. Boarding in the 90-degree heat they revealed to us that there were new mechanical problems with the replacement plane. They delivered us back to the terminal where we sat like cattle again without any information at all. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had in 40 years of traveling. United airlines gave only an empty apology by text message on our arrival in Newark referring us to a website to claim a minor token gift which could never compensate us for disastrously poor customer service. The 2 lost luggage bags that arrived 24 hours after we arrived in Punta Cana the week before seemed almost trivial in comparison. What a shame!,sad
854,10855,United Airlines,13-May-14,Canada,1,Economy,1,NO,YQB-ORD on 13 March. One reason for such low rankings is that I never actually ended up on a UA plane. Scheduled to fly out on the non-stop from Quebec City to O'Hare at 8am. The day before UA emails me that the flight is cancelled and they put me on a flight at 11.50am via EWR. Nope - not on United. Online showed the plane from EWR on-time into YQB but it never landed. Around 11.30 am the departure board shows a 3 hour delay for departure. There is not a single UA rep at the gate - and no one ever shows up to tell people what is going on. The pilots and flight attendant who are to work the trip to EWR didn't have any idea and were embarrassed that one heard it was a mechanical problem while the other heard it was weather. Every other airline into YQB was operating on-time or with 10-15 min delays due to snow in Quebec - all but United. I spent over an hour on the phone with my corporate travel trying to get on another flight - the first United agent wouldn't help my travel agent so she called back and got someone else willing to help. I ended up on Air Canada to YUL and then to ORD. Air Canada was fantastic! United - what is wrong with you? I never say never but unless it is mandated I fly on UA I won't do it. I was Platinum with them last year and Gold this year but I'll stick with American or Air Canada.,sad

The new round of checks on size of carry on is being handled in a way that has convinced me that I should never fly United again. While my bag was not over the size the agents take joy in making you size it and have the ""got you"" attitude. I am convinced the lack of space in carry on bins will no longer be a problem because any business traveler or preferred customer will have enough sense to fly with another airline. It is amazing how far United will go to alienate it's good customers.",sad
856,10857,United Airlines,12-May-14,USA,8,Economy,1,YES,Birmingham (BHX) to West Palm Beach (PBI) via Newark (EWR) Business Class. Outbound 25 Feb Inbound 10/11 Mar. Reading some of the reviews about United it would seem to be an airline to avoid however as it flies from my local airport I am more than happy to fly with them. The flights listed above all departed on time or within 10 minutes of schedule all arrived early allowing for hassle free connections. The service by both check in staff and onboard staff was perfect a lot of passenger complaints for this airline relate to staff attitudes well the attitude question works both ways some passengers are downright rude to check in and cabin crew. I have one or two gripes about the flights I am amazed at what is allowed on board as hand luggage are these people so important that saving a few minutes by missing baggage reclaim is of paramount importance to them. The entertainment system was not fully functional on the international legs. All in all the whole experience was a pleasant one I would recommend this airline for people in the West Midlands flying to the US albeit travelling in Business makes a difference but the premium economy and economy cabin looked to be ok as well.,happy
857,10858,United Airlines,12-May-14,USA,8,Economy,5,NO,On return flight to Denver plane waits for 15 minutes at DIA as ground crew is on break and between shifts even though docking space is open and available for our plane. The one checked bag I had on a direct flight from Calgary did not make the plane even though I arrived for check in at Calgary in plenty of time. As this was a small United plane it was oversold. With so many carry ons checked in below I and multiple other passengers had their luggage shifted to another plane. After waiting at the baggage carousel for 30 plus minutes all 3 lost baggage claim stations at DIA were unattended on a Sunday afternoon for over 30 minutes. When staff finally sashayed out the baggage reps stood for several minutes behind their computers talking to no one. The last 6 United flights in the past year that I and my family have taken have all resulted in some form of delays lost luggage or rude staff. I did not receive my luggage until 50 hours after my flight landed.,happy
858,10859,United Airlines,12-May-14,USA,1,Business,1,YES,Flew SLC to ORD then ORD to DCA both flights were great. The crew on both were very friendly and professional. We arrived early on both flights. I was in economy plus so plenty of leg room. Direct tv was available on ORD to DCA leg. I have flown a few of the discount airlines lately and was reminded how nice it is to fly United. Great trip!,sad
859,10860,United Airlines,11-May-14,Germany,1,First Class,2,NO,Travelled to Mexico with a family of 5. United changed our flight to Mexico at the last minute causing our arrival to be over an hour later almost negating our travel to our resort. The morning of our return I received email confirmation indicating that our connecting flight from Newark to Syracuse was cancelled. During several hours of trying to reach them and receive a new flight to get home we were finally told that we would have to stay in Newark until the next available flight. Our flight from Cancun to Newark we wanted the inflight entertainment and wanted to pay for 3 screens. Between the armrest functions not working or the unit not recognizing cards we were only able to get one screen to work. My seat was actually broken and kept reclining back on its own. When we arrived in Newark on Wed March 12 2014 we were advised that we would be able to come to that airport to standby over the next few days in order to get one or two out at a time. We are a family of 5 with two daughters. We then were told that we could fly out on the 17th of March 5 nights later at our own expense. The cancellation 13 hours before was apparently for weather but when we landed the weather was a little bit of rain. We ended up renting a vehicle one way to Syracuse from National and a 4 hour drive later we were in Syracuse. I have flown United before without issue and were extremely disappointed with the airline on this trip. I will not be flying United next vacation that is for sure.,sad
860,10861,United Airlines,11-May-14,USA,6,Economy,4,YES,Flew VIE-FRA-IAD on 5 Jan 14 all economy. First leg was on LH1237 on a A321 second leg UA933 on a B777. Was prepared for a steerage experience on UA but felt the economy seat was surprisingly comfortable and the dinner ok as well. However there was a charge for wine/beer on this international flight of 9 hrs. I contrast this with the LH flight from VIE: complimentary sandwich and complementary wine/beer on a 90 min. flight! Try getting that on a US domestic flight!,normal
861,10862,United Airlines,9-May-14,Canada,1,Economy,1,NO,"I flew to Nashville via a connection in Houston. The first flight a 60 seater was overbooked by 7! The gate agent was totally overwhelmed. When I said I might ""volunteer"" to give up my seat she asked what the code for Nashville is. Agent came on and off the plane a dozen times before we finally left 15 minutes late. Return flight from Nashville to Houston was cancelled and the robot computer rebooked my for 5.40am the next morning. All flights on original travel date were overbooked. Got to Nashville Airport and half of UA's Expressjet flights were cancelled or delayed. Every gate had the wrong flight posted and they reshuffled right before departure. Aircraft taxied for 15 minutes then sat on the runway for 20 minutes. Not one word from the cockpit. Upon arrival in Houston we sat for 10 minutes until someone showed up to pull up the boarding bridge.",sad
862,10863,United Airlines,9-May-14,New Zealand,0,Economy,2,NO,We had a connecting flight from Chicago to Montreal at 7.30pm and boarding time was at 7.00pm. Got to the airport 2 hours before our flight and decided to get a bite to eat in the terminal but first we checked the screens and our flight was on time. Left the restaurant 30 mins before boarding when we go to the flight screens we had seen that it said cancelled we did not understand why? Told that the crew had not shown up and that there were no other flights available meaning we were stuck in Chicago until the next morning. 5am wake up to catch the new flight they had scheduled us on. Got to the agent at our gate and saw the agents panicking told it would take 30 minutes to get the problem sorted. To top it off my father booked a first class seat the plane did not have a first class so he asked for an exit row seat however they wanted to charge him almost 40$ when he had already had a first class seat to begin with.,sad
863,10864,United Airlines,8-May-14,Italy,8,Premium,3,NO,"Booked a flight in December 2013 for a trip to Palm Springs in March 2014 - at that time had seat assignment - little did I know that booking in advance does not guarantee you a seat on the flight - they over booked the flight and I was bumped off my 7 am flight and spent 15 hours in San Fran airport compliments of United Airlines. Waited all day to get on a standby flight (7 that went through that day all over booked) - would have been bumped from the 11 pm flight they rescheduled me on (after bumping me in the am) had I not checked to make sure I was ""guaranteed"" on the flight. Make sure that when you check in your ticket has a seat assignment - if it says ""see agent"" make sure you go early and hopefully get it taken care off - What a terrible disregard for peoples time from United. Feel bad for the ticket agents who I watched all day get yelled at by others who were bumped unwillingly!",happy
864,10865,United Airlines,7-May-14,Canada,2,Economy,2,NO,Possibly the worst airline to fly internationally. Such a shame compared to other European and Asian airlines. Traveled on the ORD-MUN. Flight was delayed due to leakage in cargo. Apparently they found it after every one boarded the plane. Planes are ageing. Entertainment system kept rebooting automatically. Each reboot taking 5 minutes. Service was pathetic. FA's never tried to help. Beverage rounds were few and in between. Overall has been a very bad experience whenever I have flown United. Avoid it like plague.,sad
865,10866,United Airlines,6-May-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,I am forced to fly by United Airlines from were I live because they are the only airline at my local airport. I haven't flown them on an international flight since the late 90's. It was a bad experience then my latest trip was even worse. If you're looking for bad seats bad meals people who hate their jobs then this is your airline. They charged me an extra fee of $100 (USD) for my extra check in bag. I had to pay high prices for any drinks with alcohol on an International flight. They flew us home (9 hour transpacific flight from Tokyo) with a fixed cabin TV screen. No power outlet for electronics and flight attendants that made you afraid to ask for a drink of water.,sad
866,10867,United Airlines,5-May-14,Belgium,8,Economy,3,NO,I had the worst experience with this airline. I frequently fly between Hartford and Columbus. All flights out of Columbus and Hartford have a very poor on-time percentage around 40%. My return flight had been boarded with a broken air plane which led to everyone de-boarding and boarding a second plane. In return many people on the plane missed their connecting flights from the delay and had to be rebooked and stay at a hotel overnight including myself. My morning flight the next day had a delay that cost be a full business day at work. This is just one of many times I have had trouble with this airline I will not be flying again.,happy
867,10868,United Airlines,5-May-14,UK,7,Economy,1,NO,Returning to Michigan from Waikiki we got to Chicago where we found out that the plane to Detroit was cancelled. When we went to the service desk they acted like they did not care told that we could be put on stand by until the next open flight in 3 days had a seat. Their customer service was rude and uncaring. Luckily our travel agent called American Airlines and got us a flight in one hour.,normal
868,10869,United Airlines,4-May-14,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,Flew United SYD-SFO in Economy Plus. Paid $200 for exit row seat so unlimited legroom. Staff business like but not rude. Soft drinks offered soon after takeoff. Dinner was basic but that was actually welcome - steamed chicken 4 slightly shrivelled chips veg tiny Apple pie drinks offered again. Water was offered twice during overnight and a midnight ham roll and Tim Tam for those awake. Breakfast was omelette and barely recognisable sausage. IFE was shared screens but I used iPad. Overall not as unpleasant as I had feared.,sad
869,10870,United Airlines,4-May-14,Canada,10,Economy,2,NO,Flight from Midland to Salt Lake City was great. Both planes were small but that was fine. The crew were great and the reason I purchased the tickets was because it was the fastest flight. The layover was short and it was easy to find my next gate. We left and arrived on time. On my way back however totally different! I had a 6.20 flight and arrived at the airport at 4.30. The line for United Airlines was so long it extended the length of the terminal and out of the door. I stood in line for 1 hour and 20 minutes! No information given and the line did not move very quickly at all. Finally at 6 am a woman working for United started walking down the line asking if anyone was going on the 6.20 flight to IAH. Over 30 people left the line to stand in yet another line for an additional 10 minutes. No explanation was offered no apologies given. We were rushed through first class passenger line of security and I boarded the plane at 6:15 am. The plane was half full because everyone was still waiting in line. Our flight left at 6.45 because we had to wait on all the other passengers. The pilot did his best to make up time in the air and I made in time to make my connecting flight. I still have no idea what happened in SLC it seemed to me like a lot of laziness and poor customer service.,happy
870,10871,United Airlines,2-May-14,Germany,1,Economy,2,YES,Flew Dublin - Newark - Washington Dulles on 6th March on a B757 and then a D8. The cross Atlantic flight was fine on time reasonable seat good choice of movies etc. but the food was very poor - potatoes hard as was the bread no choice - it was meat or meat. On the hop from Newark to Dulles I was surprised how noisy it was though I was close to the engines. United seem to call people forward now by group number as printed on there boarding pass as opposed to seat number blocks. Not sure it helps and fail to see the logic of filling from the front back - getting the people at the back in first means less blocked aisles.,sad
871,10872,United Airlines,2-May-14,Canada,5,Economy,1,NO,It has taken me in excess of an hour to resolve what should be a simple matter on the phone with their customer service flights are always late (which I understand is not always the airline's fault but most of my late flights result from insufficient crew which they can do something about). The coach cabin is a mess and even first class which I usually take is sub par. Last time I flew first class they gave me a hard time when I asked for milk for my toddler children! Not to mention that they ran out of food. I already had low expectations for them but I did not expect to bring my own food to first class. Avoid at all costs.,normal
872,10873,United Airlines,2-May-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,NRT-BKK. Uneventful trip on a route about to be abandoned by United. Surprising considering the 747 was packed to the brim. Boarding was chaotic and those of us in business class had no idea where to line up to board. Nice hard product but uninspiring service and meal. Overworked flight attendant working business class in the dome got the job done though. Pilot had Channel 9 (air traffic control) activated which is one of the nice features that only United can claim. The RCC lounge at NRT has much to be desired - hands down had the worst cappuccino in my life there.,sad
873,10874,United Airlines,2-May-14,USA,10,Premium,2,NO,"Flew from Newark to Denver where United decided without any form of communication to hold 2 of our bags to arrive with the next flight to Denver 3 hours later. After arriving in Denver we waited at the baggage carousel for nearly an hour until we were fully convinced 2 of our bags did not make the flight. Throughout the night we tried calling different customer service numbers of United and could not get a straightforward answer. 20 hours later our bags reached us. On our flight back from Denver to Newark the entire flight was boarded seat belts fastened welcomed by the pilot until another announcement from the pilot came on and I quote ""there is a small problem. Should be a quick fix that will take best case 30 minutes"". 10 minutes later we are told to deboard the plane because this ""quick fix problem"" has caused the plane to be completely out of service. As we all deboard our entire flight is told to go to one customer service desk with 4 representatives. Nearly an hour later we finally get up to the representatives and all I hear is a potential flight to Houston reboard the out-of-commission plane at 3.30 or wait until tomorrow. Save yourselves the trouble and aggravation and never fly United Airlines!",happy
874,10875,United Airlines,2-May-14,USA,1,Premium,1,YES,LAX-JFK and return. Never flew United previously so after reading many reviews had lowered my expectations. I thought it was pretty good. I paid extra for more legroom which was well worth the money. Cabin crew came through the cabin regularly offering water or juice on the JFK-LAX leg in particular. The seats are more comfortable than Qantas economy and likewise the entertainment was a bit better also. My biggest complaint is the amount of luggage/baggage United allow passengers to drag onto the plane. If you are Group 5 (aisle seats) and the last to board all the bins are full of people's stuff from seats away! Even a pre-boarding offer to check wheelie bags for free due to a full flight was met with disinterest. It really is one area needing tightening up.,sad
875,10876,United Airlines,1-May-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,Traveling out of New Orleans Louis Armstrong airport for business around 2 pm on 3/5/14. Baggage check was totally disorganized. I was directed to a kiosk by one of the agents then waited 15 minutes after I had checked the bag electronically for someone to come and tag it. When an agent showed up to tag the bag they were clearly not in a hurry. Then my flight was delayed. Maybe there's no rush at check in because United flights are late so often.,sad
876,10877,United Airlines,1-May-14,Netherlands,5,Economy,4,NO,Washington to San Diego and San Francisco to Washington. Old planes not enough overhead storage for the amount of cabin luggage they allow people to lug in. One stewardess had a shouting discussion about the oncoming superbowl from the front of the plane to row 39. No free food on a 5 hour flight no drinks except water and fruit juices of doubtful quality. Online entertainment is a joke! Never again!,normal
877,10878,United Airlines,30-Apr-14,Israel,8,Business,3,YES,Flew UAL 218 first class from HNL-ORD then connected to UAL express ORD-YWG. Service better than expected. 777-200 had recliner seats with no flatbeds for an 8 hour flight. No inflight entertainment as WiFI was not working and the old school entertainment system had already been removed. In-Charge offered all passengers compensation through UA Website. Offer on the web site was $125 off the next UA Flight for US residents or 10% off next UA flight to be used within 1 year for international travellers. Dinner and breakfast were served. Quality of both meals were OK and reminded me of Y class meals from days gone by. Ice cream sundae cart made the rounds after dinner. First Class Attendants ensured beverages were topped up and one FA even made sure water glasses were topped up while passengers slept. Difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in recliner chairs. However the ticket price was reasonable for the passenger space offered on the aircraft. For an 8 hour overnight flight First class should offer flatbeds IMHO. UAL Express connector flight ORD-YWG ran 1 hour late due to off loading of baggage when connecting passengers failed to show. Almost an expected delay on any airline these days.,happy

You pay for your own alcohol which I don't have a problem with but theirs is expensive. Entertainment selection ok. Prem econ seats offer nothing more than extra legroom about 4"" but was worth it on long haul. Nothing to complain about there and using Houston for transit we were impressed with the speedy immigration channels which took much of the hassle out of using the States.

879,10880,United Airlines,29-Apr-14,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,I used to like flying United but the last couple of trips have really make me think about other airlines. I had to fly to Honolulu in January to take care of my mom for 2 weeks. They canceled my departing flight. My flight from Houston was delayed 2 hours and there was no personal TV on the flight. Flying home it was the same. I had to return to Honolulu in Feb. The flight to and from had no personal TV. I am not a savy personal and do not have I- pads or any personal electronics (and there were many other people like me on the plane) so using Wi-Fi did us no good. Sitting on the plan for 8 hrs plus with no entertainment really did not go over well.,sad
880,10881,United Airlines,29-Apr-14,UK,3,First Class,1,NO,May 27 through June 10 2014. The customer service for this airline really needs to be greatly improved. I book my flights in advance so I can have what I want and schedule what I am doing when I get there. So to have my flights canceled and rebooked for a flight that doesn't even come close to when my connecting flight leaves the airport is a bit stupid. Now I have to have a longer flight just to get where I want to go by flying in the opposite direction of where I want to go. To top it all off I wasn't even notified of the change. Now I have to change my plans so I can accommodate the airlines wishes. Next time I think I will book with another company that I have had no problems with.,sad
881,10882,United Airlines,28-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,YES,LAS-LAX-RNO. One way trip at the last moment due to family matters. Had enough miles in the bank to make this work. The schedule was perfect albeit a change of planes in LAX but only a short layover. Took off from Vegas a few minutes late. A short flight from LAS to LAX and the flight attendants passed by twice with beverage service. The plane was comfortable the flight good and we were in LAX before I knew it. Connecting flight from LAX to RNO was fine. Another short jaunt and again the attendants made two beverage stops. I brought my own food on to the plane so I was good. I know problems can arise that are out of our control but maybe I am one of the lucky one's. United has always done right by me. I know if I board a plane with a smile and say hello I will get that right back. I don't always expect the flight crew to be lavishing over me in economy by any means. A smile on either end goes a long ways. I have done many short and long hauls with United over the years and only once did I have an issue. United has treated me well and has my business.,sad
882,10883,United Airlines,28-Apr-14,Canada,1,Economy,1,NO,I've been a United 1K member for 2 years 7 year Platinum member on Continental prior to the merger of the two airlines. I fly over 100k miles a year on business and used to enjoy flying however over the past 3 years United has been a nightmare to fly and do business with! Loyalty means nothing customer service is non-existent and upgrades uncommon. Schedules are terrible with multiple connections expensive tickets and they're flying more and more excruciatingly uncomfortable regional planes! Been flying a different airline starting this year since they offered elite status for flying a few thousand miles during a certain timeline so far so good!,sad
883,10884,United Airlines,28-Apr-14,Australia,9,Economy,4,NO,"Hong Kong to Newark on March 1. Flight crew was tired and cranky with bad attitudes across the board. One in- flight announcement was literally a snide ""buckle your seat belt it's bumpy"". Where other airlines turn a galley into a quasi-lounge area during such a long flight (15 hours) we were told there was to be no loitering around the galley or toilet areas. I will avoid this airline as much as possible in future. The only positives were the entertainment system and that the flight was on time.",happy

When they were finally on board they found that no meals of any kind were available on the 5 hour flight to the destination.

885,10886,United Airlines,25-Apr-14,Belgium,1,Economy,3,NO,United cancelled our flight to Florida about 16 hours prior to our trip. You would think that with 16 hours to work with they could find a way to get a plane to the city I live in. Our travel agent had to scramble to make alternate arrangements with another airline. Now we are going to have to spend over twelve hours travelling and stop at one more airport. I am very angry with United's lack of compassion with our dilemma and diligence at arranging alternate flights to get us to our destination. I will never book with United Airlines again!,sad

887,10888,United Airlines,24-Apr-14,USA,3,Premium,1,NO,Traveled to Denver from Rochester NY on United twice in the past month. Every plane had a mechanical problem resulting in having to re-book multiple flights because of missed connections. In January I sat on the Tarmac for 3 hours in Rochester because someone had forgotten to drain the water out and it took that long to de-ice. On my return flight from Denver I had to be re-booked 3 times due to mechanical issues and sat in the airport for 8 hours. The only reason I finally got out was because a connecting flight from Idaho landed too late and they refused to hold the plane. In my most recent flight out of Rochester in February the altimeter was broken and we waited 6 hours for parts to be flown in from Atlanta. Oh and - I had paid extra for aisle seats in Economy Plus and ended up in the middle seat in the back of the plane. Now I have to contact Customer Service as no one in the Service Center in the Denver Airport is authorized to do so. I am dreading the return flight home. I will be flying on other carriers from now on.,sad

The missed connection and re- routing through LAX was bad enough but I guess winter weather is a reality. What is not acceptable is this new DirecTV-United deal for in-flight ""entertainment"". Now in addition to having to pay extra for a poor sandwich wrap they've got the gall to make you cough up extra to watch a movie. I object to paying for what is standard on other airlines. They take your money $1000-2000 and then expect you to pay for a movie - or even a flight map. Of course they'll say it's only $6-8 for DirecTV and provides access to many TV channels as well.",normal

United is only offering one meal service over that 14 hour period and they won't give any food to my son because he's on his mothers lap and doesn't have his own individual ticket. Some milk maybe some yoghurt a ham sandwich costs them what maybe $2? It's apparent that that extra $2 is worth more than the comfort of their lowly economy customers. Flying isn't what it used to be.,sad
891,10892,United Airlines,23-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,4,NO,"Terrible service unless you are some sort of elite status traveler. This airline wouldn't let me pick my seats during on-line check in.

When I advised gate attendant that a 9 year old would be in the exit row they stated that I ""shouldn't have agreed to the terms and conditions of those seats"". Told to leave my boarding passes and they would fix it. After 40 minutes everyone else gets on plane I go up to find out what's going on and I'm then given back my original boarding passes and told to get on the plane and they would fix it there. Onboard told to see the 2nd attendant. The 2nd attendant tells me I can't sit in the exit row with a child. An attendant moved 2 people out of their seats into the exit row and then snidely says to me ""See. that wasn't so bad was it?"".

Third was trying but seemed befuddled at multi-tasking thus often a step or two behind. Nice touch that rather than leave the mid flight option at the galley they did a more formalized service. Food on primary meal was so-so for example my tilapia and shrimp had no tilapia. The per-arrival burrito was actually quite good.

This class of service is not worth the extra cost. I would say the worst part about flying United is the unenthusiastic and unhelpful service. No big surprise to anyone who flies United regularly. I also bought the Premier Accelerator and Reward Accelerator erroneously thinking that I would maintain my Status Match level with this flight. The ""fine print"" here is that the Accelerator is not permitted in achieving status if you're doing a Match but their web site will continually advertise it to you like it is. You will also be allowed to buy this product which I now have deep regret doing.",sad
894,10895,United Airlines,20-Apr-14,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,"Our last series of flights (from the UK to the USA and also within the USA) were quite simply the worst travel experience we have had in over 30 years of being regular international and national travellers. Staff in the business class lounge were unhelpful badly informed and unfriendly. Flight was delayed and we were initially held sitting on board for several hours. Then had to de-board and a few hours later the flight was cancelled. We had to exit through the baggage hall. Despite having a lot of baggage and having already been assured we could leave our checked baggage with United staff one member of staff told us ""we won't look after this anybody can take it and it's not our responsibility and then decided to insist we take our bags out immediately. The hotel United put us in was dreadful. Put on a fight the following day. We used air miles to upgrade to business class: United's configuration of the new extra-slim business class seats is awful. 2x4x2. Paying business class and being stuck in the middle with no dividers between two people you don't know? Hardly classy treatment! Seats are so thin that anyone with broad shoulders will be very uncomfortable. One of the internal flights in the USA was so cold that everyone sat shivering in their overcoats. At every airport in the USA staff were at best ungracious and unfriendly. Everything was too much trouble for them. United has also downgraded its Silver status so that now you only get one free bag not two. It is very sad to see the appalling way that United Airlines' service has plummeted.",sad

Solved that with a pull out and then the fun started. Pilot came on and said we are rerouted and he doesn't have enough fuel but that he is protesting with the tower. Over an hour later we are at a gate being fuelled. The gate agent refused to assist me in finding another route home since 2 hours had passed and I was certain I'd missed my connection in SFO. No hotel because they said the delay was due to weather not incompetence. The new customer focus they speak of is a facade. Flight was Feb 21. SFO has comfortable chairs but not to sleep on.,happy

A gentleman came out of the gate off of a flight obviously in a hurry and quickly asked where the connecting flight for Newark was. The staff here looked at him like it was the most inconvenient question in the world. They closed the doors for the tarmac before all passengers were inside which left them outside knocking on the door. Not one member of the staff let them in so an airline customer opened the door which set off an alarm. Again the staff did nothing and let the alarm go off for minutes. Definitely not impressed not to mention every time the gal came over the loud speaker she sounded like se had no clue what was going on.

Check in was a breeze though the process within LAX domestic wing can be a bit testy. Full flight on both ways with only drinks service given on economy. No entertainment system just some random loop of Olympic commercial. Flight attendants are organized and accommodating. Storage was a bit tricky and always a pain since all pax are not checking luggage so it gets full leg room is quite cramped even though I'm only 5'8''. Landing was good and was out the airport within 10 minutes. first leg was delayed 1 hour due to late turn around of the plane pilots were very informative throughout. Flights used ancient 737 and 757 on this leg so it can get stuffy. It wasn't bad but wasn't spectacular either just something that will get you from point a to b without much fuss.,normal

This resulted in my decision to cancel my last leg (which I was going to miss anyway) with them and drive 5 hours in the middle of the night to get to my destination. I didn't want to take the risk of staying overnight and not getting home. Apparently they don't have any concern for their customers and their timelines. Probably won't fly with them again.,normal

In PSP they had 3 flights (Denver San Fran and Houston) all leaving within 30 mins. They had 3 attendants each flight left without people who were left in line because of the counter delays. Staff were less than helpful. No organization no communication. We got to the gate with 5 mins to spare.

900,10901,United Airlines,16-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Really simple flight from Los Angeles CA to Newark NJ at 11.30pm then a connecting flight from Newark NJ to Boston MA (1.5 hrs buffer). Total time should have been 6-7 hours. Problems started in Los Angeles when the gate person told us that there was a mechanical problem on the plane. Many people had connecting flights and so a long line formed. One person was at the desk creating new boarding passes. For some reason it took him about 10 000 keystrokes to issue each pass. Two hours he issued a total of two boarding passes. The line became exceedingly long and then he called in a manager who whispered in his ear then left. Another associate came in talked to the associate at the counter and walked away. Flight arrives late and then I have to wait 7 hours for another flight to Boston. Total travel time ended up being over 17 hours. Horrible experience inept customer service.,sad

Their website and mobile app are an atrocity then again the flights were absolutely fine. The 15+ years old B777s with refurbished 3-3-3 cabins are way more spacious than many of the newer planes though 31"" seat pitch in coach feels borderline cramped. IFE screens are tiny but the AVOD selection is downright impressive. Unlike previous trips the staff were courteous attentive and efficient.

There was plenty of drinks throughout the flight frequent updates from the crew and we even cut down a 40min delay to an on-time arrival to FRA - altogether an enjoyable travel experience.",sad
902,10903,United Airlines,15-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,YWG-ORD-FLL-ORD-YWG. Check seemed more complicated than other carriers but did manage to figure it out. Left YWG on-time. Arrived into ORD more or less on time. Had 50 minutes to get to next gate which was miles away. Got to the gate with about 10 minutes to spare. 4/7 of my group members got seats. Three were put up in a hotel for the afternoon and the closest United could get them to FLL the same day was to fly to MEM. They arrived in MEM only having to drive 13 hours to get to FLL. They were fairly compensated that was the only good part of the outbound trip. On the way back check in was a breeze as it was deserted. Ended up getting to the gate with about 2 hours to spare. Plane was delayed about 25 minutes aggravating but didn't lose any sleep over it. Got into ORD a couple minutes late. My connection to YWG was supposed to be 40 minutes but our plane which was coming in from SAV was 4.5 hours late leaving thus delaying us 4.5 hours. I was insulted as we only received a $7 voucher. The only shop that was open was a McDonald's which was in the American Airlines terminal which was miles away. Winnipeggers don't have much choice in air travel but I will do my best to avoid United in the future.,sad
903,10904,United Airlines,15-Apr-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,LAX-JFK EWR-LAX. Pros: two helpful ground agents and warm friendly lounge staff at LAX. Decent IFE and comfortable seat for the 5 hour flight. Cons: Too many to mention but mainly staff attitude about everything. Even the simplest task is completed with a sigh and a roll of the eyes. I've never experienced boarding a flight before while the crew talked amongst themselves and literally ignored passengers boarding - not even a request to show boarding passes. I've honestly never been tested with such consistent disdain by employees of a company to which I'm paying a considerable chunk of money. It got to the point where I just smiled to myself with amusement at their unprofessional and frankly useless and unhelpful manner. I only flew UA as a code share with AirNZ but can honestly say I will never ever waste my time or money again.,sad
904,10905,United Airlines,15-Apr-14,UK,1,Economy,1,NO,"This review relates to a 5 flight itinerary booked with United. Other than flight segment 3 which was with Lufthansa from Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC) the other 4 flights were with United Airlines. The problem started when United had a schedule change which did not allow us a legal connection in Newark (EWR) on the outbound flight to Barcelona (BCN). We received an e-mail from United informing us of a change in time to an earlier flight from Phoenix (PHX) to Newark (EWR) allowing us a legal connection for our flight. This in itself was a bit annoying since we went from an original connection time of one hour to a four hour connection. Unfortunately we ""accepted"" the change on-line which was the first error on our part. The day prior to departing from Phoenix we received the usual message telling us we could print our boarding passes. This worked fine until we checked the boarding passes only to find out there was no longer the priority boarding we had booked and paid for. This resulted in spending over an hour on the phone to United. As it turned out with every segment flown with United it was necessary to go through the whole process of having them reprint boarding passes which showed the priority boarding and then only after we had provided them with proof this had been purchased. As for the flights themselves? The usual experience of dealing with disinterested flight attendants barely edible food and the fact as I was told ""United no longer offers special meals (eg: low cholesterol or diabetic) but does provide a kosher meal for its Jewish and Muslim passengers and a beef free meal for its Sikh passengers. So all in all the poor service of United Airlines appears to be the norm more and more these days rather than the exception which really is a problem for the UA's promise that we are ""flying the friendly skies"".",sad

907,10908,United Airlines,12-Apr-14,UK,9,Economy,5,NO,I flew United on domestic US flights 3 times in last month and I am very disappointed by their customer care. They haven't informed passengers that due to delays their connection flight (on the same flight number as from Portland to Las Vegas through San Francisco) would be missed - they knew that before boarding the first plane. Secondly they ignored passengers who had to sleep at San Francisco airport on the floor having all restaurants and half of restrooms closed. When coming back from US to Poland (3 flights - 17 hours) I couldn't check an additional bag (as I should have Star Alliance Silver status) informing me that these were Lufthansa regulations and they have their own united and they don't care or I will have to pay 200$.

I left Charlotte going to Chicago and then onto Duluth MN. My Charlotte-Chicago flight was cancelled due to the weather and the agent here in Charlotte handled things quite professionally. The same held true in O'Hare when flying back to Charlotte. It was snowing pretty hard in Chicago and a number of flights were already cancelled. I asked to be rebooked on an earlier flight that was scheduled to go out. Again the agent handled things quite well. I wish all carriers had airport staff as professional as those at United.,sad
909,10910,United Airlines,9-Apr-14,USA,9,Economy,1,YES,We just finished a trip to Belize from Edmonton Canada. This was our first time using a US airline. We flew with United and we were pleasantly surprised. Our only real issue was that the TV's were not available.,happy
910,10911,United Airlines,8-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,4,NO,Flight from HNL to Denver has been sitting at gate for 2 hrs and no information given other than cargo door problem. I quit flying United several years ago but booked this flight due to price. Never again. Will now miss my connecting flight to DSM. Will not make this mistake using this airline again. On flight over to HNL the entertainment system did not work.,sad
911,10912,United Airlines,7-Apr-14,USA,3,Economy,1,NO,Worst airline I have ever been on. So far UAL has cancelled 3 flights from EWR to BOS with the excuses being weather crew and now mechanical. That's 3 separate planes. Seats in economy are tight with virtually no movement. I'll never fly them again.,sad
912,10913,United Airlines,7-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,Arrived Tullamarine (Melbourne Australia) for long planned family holiday to USA. Informed flight cancelled and next flight was two days away! No apology no explanation. Flights through to LA and then to New York uneventful. Flight home from JFK - baggage issues plane delayed on tarmac for close to two hours no amenities from staff water etc. LA connection end then delayed by non appearing traveller. Flight to Sydney diverted to Brisbane due to low fuel missed connecting flights and luggage 'lost' (arrived 11pm four days later). United never again.,sad
913,10914,United Airlines,3-Apr-14,Canada,6,Economy,1,YES,GLA-EWR-MCO return. Transatlantic flights were pretty decent considering they were on a 757-200. The staff were friendly enough and the food both ways was fine either chicken beef or veggie option soft drinks free pay for alcohol. Flights in the US were OK with more legroom than the transatlantic flights and both were pretty much on time. Overall a decent enough product if you don't set your expectations too high and with United flying direct to the US from Glasgow I would use them again for the convenience of not flying via London or Amsterdam.,normal
914,10915,United Airlines,3-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,3,YES,YOW-ORD-HNL-LIH and return HNL-ORD-YOW. We were lucky to have a great inflight crew both ways. Perhaps the inflight crew was in a great mood going to Hawaii and as well maybe a very relaxed crew returning home. Goes to show you what a difference in a great attitude makes. The passengers were also very co-operative. We did leave Chicago 3 hours late. We had to finally switch planes. Good thing that the replacement plane had the same seat configuration which avoided a lot of chaos. Wish all my flights were as positive as this one.,sad
915,10916,United Airlines,2-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,4,NO,Worst airline and worst customer service anyone can ever imagine. 4 hour delay on the plane then cancellation next morning again 4 hour delay while sitting on the plane and then cancellation. 3rd day waiting for an hour to get my luggage checked in when there were only 3 people in front of me. Staff had no idea. This was from Regina to Denver. By the time we were done with staff we were already late for boarding.,sad
916,10917,United Airlines,2-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,3,YES,Just returned from a 3 week trip LHR-ORD-SEA returned ACV-SFO-LHR much better flight with united then previous flights in 2013. Inflight entertainment much improved food pretty much the same flew economy plus cabin free alcohol outbound but alcohol charged on the inbound flights. Far greater than Virgin Atlantic will fly United again when I travel in two months.,sad
917,10918,United Airlines,2-Apr-14,USA,5,Economy,1,NO,Just flew United to Honolulu from Canada. Worst possible flight from Chicago. No entertainment no WiFi and absolutely no food or snacks were given. Mechanical issue delayed us for 2 hrs. Will never fly United again.,normal
918,10919,United Airlines,1-Apr-14,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,My husband's father passed away 2 days ago. We scrambled to get him on a flight that wasn't too terribly expensive and would get him there in an expeditious manner. He flew from LAX to SFO. The plane he was supposed to be on in SFO had mechanical difficulties. They brought in another plane from Vegas. This second plane had problems as well. It took an additional 5.5 hours for him to get on his way to his family.,sad
919,10920,United Airlines,1-Apr-14,UK,1,First Class,4,YES,Flew LAX-SFO-ORD-LAX last week in First. Had a really enjoyable service and even with a 45 minute weather delay due to incoming aircraft off the east coast still arrived in O'Hare relatively punctual. Outbound aircraft was the 737-900 with Boeing Sky Interior - which is very calming for a 4.5 hour flight. The only drawback was it was so new that the IFE hadn't been installed yet (not a deal-breaker as I normally read/work). Return aircraft 757-200 International config with on-demand. The best part of the trip were the crew. Both directions they were attentive and intuitive. They learned my drink order upon getting settled in and never had to ask again (with repeated re-fills). Menus have been upgraded and for a domestic First it was a great experience and worth the ticket.,sad
920,10921,United Airlines,1-Apr-14,USA,7,Business,1,NO,Delay of 4 hours then cancellation with another 4 hour wait for customer service on scheduled flight from SFO to HNL is totally unforgivable and there were no weather issues involved. Date of travel was to be 18 Jan 2014 and rebooked on 19 Jan 2014. Definitely cannot recommend United ever again.,normal
921,10922,United Airlines,1-Apr-14,Singapore,1,Premium,3,NO,Took several flights in the last couple of months from EWR-HKG ORD-HKG NRT-EWR. The only positive item is inflight entertainment on the 777. Food: first meal - barely edible snack: unedible (half frozen sandwich) third meal: terrible. Now United have started charging for wine on such flights which last year didn't. Staff: terrible: I was given terrible attitude by a flight attendant didn't respond to several attendant calls for a long time. There are several airlines doing such routes all of them providing far better service than United.,sad
922,10923,United Airlines,1-Apr-14,USA,1,First Class,1,NO,Flew from HKG-ORD and ORD to IAD. I had very low expectations on United. Surprisingly HKG-ORD ultra long haul flight has excellent service. Probably this is because the flight is staffed by Hong Kong-based crews. The 777-200ER aircraft has decent AVOD. Food is average but the crews offer multiple drink runs throughout the flight. ORD to IAD domestic flight is normal US standard. Only drink is served. PTV is useless unless you pay to watch Direct TV. Service by cabin crew very average. The experience is 4 star for the international flight and I would not hesitate to fly United if Hong Kong crews serve the flight.,sad
923,10924,United Airlines,28-Mar-14,USA,4,Economy,4,NO,My pregnant wife and I had to fly to Maryland from Hawaii. As we were leaving for the airport I get a notification that the plane was experiencing mechanical issues and the flight was delayed. I contacted them and discussed how our delay was going to affect our connecting flight in San Francisco. I was told it would not be an issue. Upon arrival in San Francisco I learned that was not the case. I was told we had to wait a few hours and was going to Houston where I would be connected to Baltimore. We arrived in Houston and was greeted by another rude employee telling us the delay caused us to miss the connector to Baltimore and would get us a later flight putting us in Baltimore around 10pm and that was our only option. I walked outside to get some air and saw a supervisor at the ticket counter. I explained the story to her she offered to get on a flight that would put us in DC. On our arrival we learned that after what was to be a 12-13 hour flight that turned into a twenty something hour flight zig zagging across country. United did not have our luggage and it was sitting in an airport in New Jersey.,normal
924,10925,United Airlines,28-Mar-14,New Zealand,2,Economy,1,NO,Flight from Houston to SLC on 2/1/2014 a family of six including a 6 year old 4 year old and twin 2 year olds. When we checked in at the gate the gentleman at the gate was very short and rude and bluntly stated that we had not reserved our seating online as required when actually we had several months in advance. He took our tickets and forced us to stand by and wait for everyone else to board the plane every time we tried to ask him any questions he completely ignored and avoided us. After everyone else was on board he shoved some tickets at us and sent us on the plane with 4 small kids and 2 car seats. We were scattered throughout the plane. Fortunately the staff on the plane were accommodating enough to rearrange seating a little in order to get my husband or I as close as possible to our kids but we were still very separated. We also found out that several other families were separated on the plane as well. The entire flight was very stressful and unnerving and after this experience I will never fly with United again based on the treatment of the man at the gate. I would not recommend United Airlines to any families as none of our flights were accommodating to young families with kids and car seats as most airlines are.,sad
925,10926,United Airlines,28-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,Lost bags delayed flights lack of communication wrong allocation of seats (such as row 50 in an airline that only has 46 rows) and rude staff have made my collective experience with United Airlines a negative one. To give them 1 star for each of these categories is a stretch. I wish I had read the reviews before booking so many flights with them as it seems that the rest of their previous customers are just as satisfied as I. Literally days wasted in airports and kilometres walked trying to get answers from staff who clearly are in the wrong line of work given their communication skills. Never again.,sad
926,10927,United Airlines,27-Mar-14,USA,1,First Class,1,NO,"DEN-LHR on Christmas Eve. No food service for 50% of Economy class cabin as crew claimed that ground staff forgot to load enough food for all passengers in this class due to ""holiday mood"". When complained to crew they said it is unfortunate and can send letter to head office if dis-satisfied with service. Last time to fly with UA.",sad
927,10928,United Airlines,27-Mar-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,Newark to Hong Kong in Economy Plus. The flight left early and arrived late which made for a 16.5 hour flight. It was a very smooth flight and the fasten seatbelt sign was turned off 2 hours after take-off. I asked for a glass of red wine and was told that United began charging $7.99 a glass on flights across the Pacific Ocean on Jan 1 2014. No hot towels were provided. The meal came with plastic tableware. The individual in-flight entertainment worked well on the 777-200. 2 hours before landing there were a couple of bumps and the fasten seatbelt sign was on for the remaining 2 hours of the flight. On a 16 hour flight it is nice to use the toilet to freshen up before landing. No toothbrush or socks were provided. I purchased the more expensive W ticket because I had an upgrade but the business/first section was full two weeks before departure.,sad
928,10929,United Airlines,27-Mar-14,USA,6,First Class,3,NO,I took United from Paris to Washington DC and then from DC to Richmond VA. The first flight was ok despite no communication or service from the crew. The second flight has one hour delay so far. Not very happy about flying with United. I won't recommend it.,normal
929,10930,United Airlines,26-Mar-14,USA,1,Business,2,NO,We flew from Newark to Panama City Panama. Flight arrived 30 mins late at 11pm. The flight was OK except for no entertainment as the paying entertainment was not worth it. No free food even that had to be paid for - we didn't. Pilots were pretty uncommunicative and the cabin crew indifferent. The seats are real torture too narrow hard and poor legroom combine to make 5 hours feel like forever!,sad
930,10931,United Airlines,25-Mar-14,Canada,2,Economy,1,YES,ORD-FLL on 18 January. Paid for upgrade to 1st class as a birthday treat! Very helpful staff at ORD to assist with check-in. As a Star Alliance Gold with A3 following security checks I was able to use the Club Lounge facilities. Being morning items for a continental type breakfast were available. The lounge was however very busy. The flight boarded on time and departed 30 minutes late due to airport operational issues at FLL. (out of&nbsp; the control of UA) Orders for breakfast were taken prior to departure (2 choices) and delivered in a friendly way while en-route. The aircraft B737-800 appeared new the cabin was clean and comfortable. In spite of the late departure the flight arrived in FLL around 5 minutes late.,sad
931,10932,United Airlines,24-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Flew Denver to Tokyo Flight left 2 hrs. late (mech) so we missed our connecting flight arrived 9 hrs late. On the way back they changed our seats at boarding and put us next to the bathroom got to hear the toilet flush and the door slam for 10 hours I'll never fly United again.,sad
932,10933,United Airlines,24-Mar-14,USA,1,Premium,1,YES,IAD to DEN. Economy class on a 757. On time for departure and arrival quite good service from attendants. Aircraft sported outdated overhead CRT for in flight entertainment and my audio jack didn't work correctly. Also no wifi or power outlets. Seats comfy but a little small. Had to pay 9 dollars for a large snack which is too much frankly. Fine for the low fare I got but not much else.,sad
933,10934,United Airlines,24-Mar-14,Ireland,4,Economy,1,NO,We flew to Geneva from ABQ on 1/16 - 1/26. Flight UA5176 UA907 UA975Y UA783Y. To start we had a 5 hr delay and our party of 6 had to be split up and re-routed to reach our overseas destination (this was not due to weather). United offered us a measly 7$ credit that was only usable in one airport for food. It didn't even cover a meal. When we finally were on our way there were further delays (once again not weather) and upon arrival our party was split and we had to pt double to take the shuttle separately to our hotel. Very frustrating trip with United!,normal
934,10935,United Airlines,22-Mar-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,IAH to CVG: Crowded dirty late with poor customer service from distracted personnel. They act like they simply don't care. If you enjoy riding Greyhound Bus Lines and want to have that same experience in the air fly United.,sad
935,10936,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,USA,1,Business,2,NO,I purchased first class tickets hoping to make the experience a little better it didn't help. The food on the flight is horrible. You get a snack box which consists of a couple of crackers some cheese spread a fig cookie and some kind of cranberry bar. That is not first class service to me. To make matters worse my bags were lost. It would have taken them two hours to drive it to me instead they had to fly it back then ship it to the correct place. This took about 24 hours when it should have taken 2. To make matters even worse on the flight home my bags didn't make it again. I was told they got put on the later flight. I won't be flying United anymore.,sad
936,10937,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,Thailand,7,Business,3,YES,I personally have had few problems with them over the last several months. Recently did DEN-SFO-HNL and back. All flights on time and with early arrivals DEN-SFO segments with newer aircraft with PTVs. The SFO-HNL segments were on the oldest 777 I have ever seen - no food no entertainment nothing for 5 hours is not really acceptable. Crews smiled on all segments and actually seemed happy to be at work which is a change. Ground staff at SFO were also helpful.,normal
937,10938,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,Thailand,6,Economy,3,NO,Flew United 261 LAX to Orlando Economy Plus. No music no movie (not even plug for headset) only ability to purchase wifi for $9.99. Remodelled seats with less padding.,normal
938,10939,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,UK,1,Economy,5,NO,Beijing to Chicago leg of world trip. Completely full flight seats are ridiculously tight all around even for a slender person toilets a mess service dismal - did not respond to 3 different customer call buttons for over 45 minutes. Arrived safely and on time. No more long haul flights on United as Singapore is the winner for economy class.,sad
939,10940,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,Thailand,1,Economy,3,NO,With our flight leaving Jan 6 and no seat assignments we went to the airport the night of the 5th and stood in line for 2 hrs waiting to see a ticket agent. A very nice agent was able to secure seats on our flight. Same thing on the way back. Again in San Francisco no seat assignment. 33 people had to stand in line at the gate and have boarding passes re-issued with their seat assignments. Then people in group 4 and 5 had to go back to the gate counter to check our bags because of limited overhead storage. Two things in closing. Expect a big headache if flying out of S/F and I will try to find any other airline before I fly United.,sad
940,10941,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,Thailand,1,Economy,3,NO,"San Francisco to Seattle return four weeks later in First Class. Cabin Crew were wonderful and free drinks including alcohol but for a two hour flight in First Class no food was offered but a bag of crisps not really acceptable. But what lets this airline down and why I will never fly with them again is the rudeness and incompetence of their ground crew. Checking in at Seattle there was a problem with our reservation even though we had a confirmation booking. We were referred to a very rude female attendant who informed us that we would have to telephone Air New Zealand to solve the problem. We had no USA coins to make a phone call yet she said to us ""I have a big queue of people to deal with I cannot help you"". If this is how United treat their First Class Passengers I would hate to be a passenger in Coach! Never again with United!",sad
941,10942,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,Thailand,1,Economy,3,NO,Ticket from London to San Jose with connecting flight in Chicago overall quite disappointing. Food and the entertainment system were only available for purchase (flight length: 6 hour). Staff was extremely impolite and non competent: we ask to have information regarding connecting flight procedures and most of the indication received were not correct: they reassure us that our luggage was already checked in therefore no need to check in again once in US. As soon as we landed we discover that indeed we HAD to go through custom with our luggage and therefore check in again. They reassured us that there would have been someone to come to pick us up at the plane in order to help as with the connecting flight procedure. No one came to pick us up at arrival but the United counter outside custom was left unattended / empty for at least 15 minutes (which result in us missing the connecting flight).,sad
942,10943,United Airlines,18-Mar-14,Canada,1,Economy,2,YES,Melbourne to San Francisco. United are phasing out the 747 and replacing it with the newer 777. The main issues I had was with the seat width with no where to put your arms without rubbing the passenger sitting next to you. On a 14 hour flight it is quite stressful having someone invade your personal space. The foods service was also very ordinary and basic in comparison to other airlines offering e.g. Qantas. Unfortunately United offers the fastest and most direct routes to Australia from San Francisco when compared to the other carriers I.e.Qantas Virgin Australia. Flight Attendants are attentive and work hard. The actual inflight experience needs to improve. Headset jack in seat was broken but had my own entertainment from my iPad.,sad
943,10944,United Airlines,18-Mar-14,UK,7,Premium,5,NO,I flew from New Orleans to Sao Paulo with connecting flight from Chicago to Sao Paulo. I had no room to put overnight bag in overhead bin and was told to find a place or go check baggage. The food was horrible. My seat didn't recline and asked for help and attendant didn't return. Will never fly United again and will not recommend them.,normal
944,10945,United Airlines,18-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,My flight from Houston to Kansas City was scheduled at 11.20 am. The scheduled arriving time of the incoming aircraft from Monterray was 11.33 and arrived at 11.31. How to keep the schedule keeping in mind that a change of aircraft from international to domestic flight takes approx. one hour? It demonstrates that arriving on time by flying United is pure luck. And of course no announcement in advance. The information at the airport was awaiting incoming aircraft.,sad
945,10946,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,USA,3,Economy,3,YES,MAN-EWR-MAN. Premium economy out and regular back. First experience with United and also first time transatlantic on a narrow body. Seats were fine legroom in economy plus a bonus but other than that no benefits over standard economy. Staff pleasant flights on time and seats reasonably comfortable. Food was very good as was seat back entertainment. Only minor issue was the need to keep carry on under seats due to overheads being full. Would recommend and certainly use again. Point to point beats wasting time in transit.,sad
946,10947,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,USA,2,Premium,3,NO,Arrived at the airport an hour early as expected and the flight was oversold. The agent refused to check us in or check my bags great reception for a family of 3 first class passengers as she said we weren't there 1.5 hours beforehand. Gate agent stalled until the flight departed and continued to say she was having trouble entering passports until all the connections had left and could only rebook the next day.,sad
947,10948,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,UK,2,Economy,4,NO,"I make a round trip flight from the west coast to Japan every 3 months. Usually fly with Korean or Hawaiian. This time because the price was a little less. I flew on United/ANA. The people staff were friendly but the space in the cabin was by far tighter than any of the other carriers that we have used over the last year. When you are on a 12-15 hour flight it makes a big difference. Space - not acceptable baggage allowance - not acceptable food - barely acceptable. Total: chose a different carrier (unless you are 5'2"" or less and saving $50 is the only consideration).",sad
948,10949,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,San Francisco to Tokyo. The entertainment system did not work for first couple of hours. The distance between the seats is terrible (on the way back I used ANA the distance is much-much bigger). All lavatories were dirty and smelt. For the broken entertainment system they told us to go to their site and apply for some kind of reward. A month later and nothing. No more United!,sad
949,10950,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,USA,2,Economy,5,NO,Stockholm - Newark - Las Vegas - Chicago - London. Like many others I got stuck in Newark due to the weather problems which I guess is out of United's control. However throughout the process of finding a new flight I felt like all ground staff just wanted to get rid of me. Never did they express any type of sympathy for my stressful situation. On the way back United did not manage to check me in on a connecting flight with a Star Alliance partner (so much for the seamless experience). They did not offer any real help to solve the problem either and just referred me to my travel agency. Later I learned that it was actually United themselves that had caused the problem when rebooking my outbound flight without updating the all legs of the journey! The actual flight experience was not that great poor food old planes poor entertainment systems grumpy ladies serving drinks etc.,sad
950,10951,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,Canada,5,First Class,2,YES,UA 1065 EWR-MEX. I scored a last minute upgrade which made the trip very enjoyable. The Business service was quite good. Only fault is catering doesn't match their printed menus. I would've preferred the pasta but there are only two pasta entrees from catering so I had the fish. It was decent. Flight crew extraordinarily friendly.,normal
951,10952,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,USA,10,Economy,4,NO,Flew on LHR-EWR route. On our way out to NY was just what you expected from an airline of this reputation nothing special average performance. However on 6th Jan from EWR to LHR on UA0044 I can only describe the whole experience as hell. Turned up at the airport at 6am 3 hrs ahead of our flight waited patiently in the long line. When we got to an agent she told me I may have a seat but my hubby has a standby ticket because the flight is oversold. I tried to question the absurdity (we bought tickets a year ago flew the week before and turned up at the airport 3 hrs early for check-in). Puzzled and panicking we went through security believing that there was some sort of mistake. Proceeded to our gate hoping to speak to someone but there were already plenty of people like us lining up asking similar questions. We had to wait until everyone was on board. Until they closed the gate eventually around 11 I had never heard a single apology from the 3 ladies at the gate. Eventually told there were no seats left and told to go to customer service with some food vouchers and some check to clear. Still no apology no explanation. We finally got on a plane that night and only to find that our bags were missing when we got to LHR. Seats ok food awful crew needs some training on PA and would be really nice to see some smiley faces if possible.,happy
952,10953,United Airlines,14-Mar-14,USA,8,First Class,2,NO,After boarding flight 1120 from San Diego to Chicago the steward announced that we would be deplaning because there was no pilot. 3 hours later the new pilot announced that the delay was caused by United who sent the scheduled crew to San Francisco the night before putting them over the new regulations for rest time between flights. He said United knew this and failed to schedule a new crew or alert passengers timely. I missed my Connection in Chicago. The bad weather set in and I spent two nights in Chicago. Instead of a direct flight to Harrisburg on Monday I had to connect at D.C I missed that connection because of a weight imbalance on the plane and ended up spending over $230 to rent a car to drive to Harrisburg. I understand weather delays but I would have been home before the storm set in if United hadn't screwed up big time.,happy
953,10954,United Airlines,13-Mar-14,Canada,2,Premium,1,NO,My international flight from Seattle to Narita on Jan 6th was average in quality and I was about as comfortable as one can be on a 14 hour flight. The connecting flight from KCI to Denver on Jan 5th was atrocious and for no good reason at all. While a huge number of flights into and out of Denver were being canceled due to weather this incidental connecting flight was delayed for hours because of poor planning. Boarding was delayed because the plane's heating system failed. When we did board it was still freezing. The de-icing process also took longer than expected. When we finally arrived in Denver we were told to wait in the longest customer service line I had ever seen. All of us were wasting our time. We waited 3 hours to be told we should have left on a flight that left about an hour after we landed. The customer service workers in Denver and Seattle were very helpful and very overworked but I'm sorry to say they are the exception to the rule. Most were capable but unwilling to help. All of my other flights with United have been completely average nothing to complain about and most have been international. For the most part United is a pretty average airline. But if you get in a pickle the poor quality of the majority of United's staff is likely to snowball your problems and delays.,sad
954,10955,United Airlines,12-Mar-14,USA,3,First Class,1,NO,Booked with a family of 6 from Orlando to Houston to Vancouver. No notice that check-in line was 7 hrs because of storms in North East. Our flight was delayed to the point we could not connect in Houston. We were encouraged to go on standby. We were never placed on the standby list by the United Staff member. However our luggage left. We were also told that failing the standby flight we were booked on a flight 5 days later. When I called to confirm two days later there was a reported 12 hour hold queue. Finally got through to United to be told we were not booked on any flight to return. It appears the staff member only told us what we wanted to hear to get us out of the airport - nothing they said was true. Flew Westjet home. I understand that weather happens but deal with the resulting issues with some honesty and class. I will never deal with United again. 3 days home and still no luggage.,sad
955,10956,United Airlines,12-Mar-14,USA,5,Business,2,NO,"I will never fly United ever again. Leaving from LAX-ELP United decided to do ""maintenance"" on the aircraft before it takes off which set us back 2 hours in departure which meant most everyone was going to miss their connecting flight in Denver. We were redirected to the customer service which took 1.5 hrs standing in line to finally be told that there were no flights until the next day that could take me home. Ridiculous. At least they had the decency to pay for the hotel. Next day fly out to Denver waiting for my connecting flight to ELP there is a 30 minute delay again because of ""maintenance"". Plane supposed to leave at 3 at 4 they tell us that we are changing gates and plane so more delays and we are still waiting to know what time they decide to leave since apparently we are running on their time schedule. I cannot believe how unorganized this airline is and how they make traveling so torturous.",normal
956,10957,United Airlines,12-Mar-14,USA,9,Business,1,NO,What a horrible experience and lack of customer service. I flew from Boston MA with a connecting flight from Washington Dulles to Atlanta. I was scheduled to arrive at 2.45 but I did not arrive until 7.45pm. To top it all off our bags did not arrive either. We were shuffled from gate to gate then to another terminal. There were no weather delays whatsoever and no explanation was offered. When our airplane finally taxied off we still had to wait on the runway because the airplane had no fuel. Then I was told my luggage was arriving at 1 am. It is now 5 pm the next day and I have been given an eta but still no bag. Needless to say I will not be flying United again. The lack of customer service leaves a lot to be desired.,happy
957,10958,United Airlines,11-Mar-14,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,Flew United from Tokyo Japan to Bangkok Thailand. Pretty disappointing. Despite being a fairly long international flight there was no real entertainment choices like on most other airlines. Service was friendly enough. We had a delay of four hours and United did not even let us know which was also disappointing. Got us from point A to point B but with no frills or exceeding of expectations.,sad
958,10959,United Airlines,11-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,San Francisco to Hong Kong with United was substandard in every regard. Firstly boarding was a disorganized mess. Once on board the decrepit old plane was woefully short of enough storage space for customer's bags. Twice a stressed out crew member stood on my seat without really excusing herself to try and cram bags into the overhead storage. Next I was dismayed and shocked to discover we had shared TV screens on a 14.5 hour flight. Scheduling a plane for such a long flight that has shared TV screens is ridiculous. Thirdly I was baffled by the fact that United now charges for alcohol on international flights - the only airline to do so. I do not expect to have to pay for a glass of wine with my dinner on a 14 hour plus flight. I suspect that United will lose a lot of international customers with this short sighted and stingy policy. Next problem was that my vegetarian meal that I had booked weeks before wasn't available. I had to make do with scraps that the crew could find. So shared TV charged for alcohol my reserved meal unavailable and an old uncomfortable and falling apart plane. Why would anyone choose to fly with an old fashioned and out of touch airline?,sad
959,10960,United Airlines,10-Mar-14,Australia,1,Economy,3,NO,"I arrived in Chicago at 4.30pm and was supposed to be on a connecting flight to Mobile AL at 6.30 arriving around 8.30. After being at the airport about 10 minutes the flight was delayed until 9.30. 10 minutes later it was pushed up to 8.30. An hour later we got delayed until 9.30 and had a gate change. 30 minutes later we were delayed until 10.00 and another gate change. As soon as we got to that gate we were informed we had been delayed yet again until 10.30 and that we had another gate change in a completely different terminal building. By the time we got to that terminal the flight had been cancelled. They told us the next flight to mobile wasn't leaving for 24 hours. We eventually got to New Orleans and had to rent a car to drive home. United had no remorse and their response was ""sorry"".",sad
960,10961,United Airlines,10-Mar-14,USA,10,Economy,2,NO,"We were a family of 4 with 2 children under 7 traveling from San Francisco to Mexico City. United has the only direct service between these 2 cities and we have flown the route perhaps 10 times in the past. The flight to Mexico used to be a morning one but now it is an inconvenient night flight. The legroom was very tight on the Boeing 737 but everything went to plan. Return flight was an early morning flight and we arrived at the airport at 4.30am and were informed that the flight had been cancelled due to ""no crew"". Waited in line over 5 hours to talk to a ticket agent and she put us on standby to Houston and to connect from there. Got called at the gate and told only two of us could go which was ridiculous. We spent 18 hours meeting flights at various gates and told to come back in the morning. We got hotel vouchers but only after insisting. The following morning we were given a confirmed flight a full week from our scheduled flight so I booked a flight with American Airlines through Dallas to San Francisco. Check-in was electronic and we only had to stand in line for 30 minutes to check the baggage. This fiasco cost us an extra $2000.",happy
961,10962,United Airlines,10-Mar-14,UK,5,Premium,4,NO,Flew from San Jose CR to London ON. Dec 20th. Flight to Houston was ok. Flight to Chicago O'Hare was delayed due to engine trouble. By the time I made it O'Hare airport I was told my flight to London had been cancelled and I needed to go to customer services. I waited in that line for 4 hrs. Told they could fly me to London on Sunday 2 days away from then. A manager told me she could fly me into Toronto the next morning but I would need to find my own way from there. She also informed me that I will be getting a reimbursement for my travel from Toronto to London. To make me feel better they gave me a hotel and food vouchers (this was around 1am and my flight was at 7am). I was also informed my bags would take about 2-3 hrs to get or and I could leave them there and they will send them to Toronto. Well the next day everything went normally. Except my luggage never made it out of Chicago. That took another 3 days to show up.,normal
962,10963,United Airlines,7-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,SJO-ORD - Flight cancelled. Flew SJO-IAD-ORD. Worst customer service. Tried to contact local number for 1.5 hrs with no answer. Service is bad food is very marginal flight attendants and personnel at counter were rude.,sad
963,10964,United Airlines,7-Mar-14,USA,1,Premium,3,NO,December 31 2013 flew from Tampa to Saskatoon SK. Flight from Tampa to Chicago was good. Problems started in Chicago. First plane had problems with power outage broken air conditioning system trouble restarting engines after they had been shut down and a long wait for de-icing. Finally we were allowed off the plane after sitting for over two hours. Next plane scheduled for us had a flat tyre and frozen toilet. Third plane had a frozen toilet which seemed to be fixed by a bevy of maintenance men carrying buckets of hot water. Very little information received from airline staff. Received $7 food voucher that we could only use at a Starbucks as everything else in the airport was closed. Customer service reps would rebook flights but would not issue hotel vouchers because our flight had not be cancelled. We finally got off the ground 7 hours late. Not a nice way to end a holiday.,sad
964,10965,United Airlines,7-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,I was scheduled to fly out of Dulles Airport on Jan 6 2014. I showed up to the airport to check in and found out that my flight to El Salvador was cancelled. No one had taken the time to notify me of the cancellation. Everyone I asked was rude and bothered by my questions. I waited in line for 3.5 hours to reschedule my flight two days later. The entire experience was horrible. All other flights at Dulles were able to take off except for United. I didn't expect the same bad service from them again but unfortunately nothing has changed.,sad
965,10966,United Airlines,6-Mar-14,Australia,1,Premium,4,NO,MSN-DVE-SMF. Horrible experience. The flight delays I can live with its winter. However what I don't understand was why no beverage service the attendant said there wasn't time to refresh the stock. Then in Denver we're delayed again ok its snowing I get it. The gate attendant was friendly and said we would be on the plane in an hour which we were. But what he didn't say was we would sit on the ramp waiting for the crew for 2 hours. Why board the passengers without the crew present? And the cabin was blazing hot it must have been 85f in there why? The last few inches the airlines have squeezed out has really made a difference for me. The gate attendant told use to hold our coats in our lap so the carry on luggage would fit well that's fine but we paid $50 to check our bags so we wouldn't have to sit with bags and coats in our lap in a much to cramped space.,sad
966,10967,United Airlines,6-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,"I was scheduled on a direct flight from Pittsburgh to Denver 1/5/14 at 7.20am. The check in line was crazy it was a busy travel day but they must have been understaffed because no other major airlines had lines like that. After waiting in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes I made my way through security and to the gate. There was no bad weather here or there so I was feeling confident. 5 minutes before boarding the sign at the gate changed from ""On time"" to 'Cancelled'. We were not given any information but told to call the 800 number. I waited in line for 3 hours at the desk only to be told the soonest they could get me to Denver was 10pm the following evening. Since I was travelling for work and could not arrive two days late I went down to collect my bags which took 45 minutes to arrive and a worker down there said the flights were cancelled because the crew were over their hours. That seems like a problem that should have been anticipated. It was my worst travel experience ever.",sad
967,10968,United Airlines,6-Mar-14,Austria,9,Premium,1,YES,The east coast storm pandemonium caused many flight cancellations including mine but phone agent was easily able to rebook me on the next available flight out of the New York area without too much trouble. Check in on the other hand wasn't as seamless with wait times being long even whilst using premier access understandable though due to airport congestion from weather delays. Flew on UA's newest 737-900 aircraft from Newark to SFO - the dimmed mood lights offered a soothing atmosphere albeit the squished seat. Shockingly service was actually existent on this flight by cabin crew with frequent drink runs and cheerful interactions which is a rare for me on this airline. Food however was an issue with the meals for sale having run out by the first few rows leaving many passengers to be starved on a 6.5 hour flight. A pre order option should at least be available if they're going to charge passengers for food on such a long flight. The friendly and inviting service continued on my second leg from SFO to Orange County bringing me to rethink my position on United.,happy
968,10969,United Airlines,6-Mar-14,Canada,1,Economy,4,NO,"Try sitting through a 17 hour flight from Sydney to San Francisco with only a Jane Austin movie and similar rubbish as your main entertainment on the front screen. I took the precaution of checking the United website prior to booking with them for the first and last time. I was very concerned that spending the better part of an entire day on a plane required individual entertainment units to stop prison-like boredom. The website stated that all United Airlines planes from Sydney to the USA are 747-500 and all are fitted with individual entertainment units. There was no proviso that this ""luxury"" did not extend beyond business class into Premium economy where I was seated. My plane left Sydney over 3 hours late causing me to miss my connecting flight to New York I had to wait more than 8 hours at the airport. The situation only got worse on my return flight. The official reason stated by the captain for the more-than 4 hour delayed departure was that flight crew had to arrive at Newark from Oakland CA. The reason given by United in the boarding lounge to their customers was that there would be a short delay while they waited for catering and fuelling. Had the airline any integrity and any concern for their passengers (especially those with international connecting flights) they would have announced at the scheduled boarding time that there would be a delay of approximately 4-5 hours. This may just have given me time to organise another flight to LAX which would have connected to my flight to Australia. The message is simple: if you need reliability fly another airline.",sad
969,10970,United Airlines,6-Mar-14,UK,2,Economy,3,NO,I booked a flight for my son from MIA to Toronto (MIA to IAD: UA511) and (IAD to YYZ: UA6146). Flight 511 departed 2 hours late. At Washington Dulles he found the flight 6146 was cancelled. Told he'd be in a waiting list for a later flight (UA6126) which was also cancelled. No explanation and no respect for passengers. If today flights have been cancelled I am not sure tomorrow flights will be departing with the weather getting worse so what happens with the people that have their plans classes that will restart on Monday as in the case of my son. In my entire life I never felt so angry and frustrated with an airline and never faced a situation like this.,sad
970,10971,United Airlines,5-Mar-14,USA,9,Premium,2,NO,NRT-SFO-NRT. Has to be the worst airline I have flown! All flights were late food inedible crew extremely rude and unhelpful. Toilet had a pool of urine on the floor and trays were snatched from passengers.,happy
971,10972,United Airlines,5-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,Unhelpful and rude staff who didn't communicate what was happening. Due to a 4.5 hour delay for flight leaving New York I missed my connecting flight and asked them to rebook only to be told the next flight in 24 hours was full. They wouldn't pay for a nights accommodation and the only option they gave me was a 15 hour flight 11 hour wait at another airport then taking the final leg home (to NZ). They also lost my luggage and tried denying any responsibility. Will never fly this airline again.,sad
972,10973,United Airlines,5-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,5,YES,Newark-Tokyo via Frankfurt. Check-in was absolutely absurd. Since I had an International flight with 2 different carriers United and All Nippon Airways and not a US Citizen the self check-in kiosk was not letting me check- in. I was calling the United ground staff for 10 minutes and was finally approached by one of them - I wouldn't blame them actually the counters were obviously short staffed. When they weighed my bags they told me I had to remove half a pound! In addition the flight was delayed 4 hours. Fortunately while we were waiting we were given food vouchers and other amenities. United finally opened a counter for passengers with connecting flights and they were trying the find other flights going to Tokyo from Frankfurt at a later time than the scheduled one. United made an announcement that the flight was cancelled. Finally from then onwards United handled the situation very well. They opened several service counters for airline representatives to rebook passengers flights. They quickly rebooked me on a direct non-stop flight to Tokyo the following morning and provided me and all other passengers with hotel rooms and an additional food vouchers worth US$40. A week later they even compensated for the trouble caused.,sad
973,10974,United Airlines,5-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"Checked in for a flight to Tokyo 2 hours early and was told by United staff that I ""needed to run"" to my flight to make it on time. I cleared security and ran for 15 minutes with a backpack on through Bangkok's massive Suvarnabhumi airport. After arriving at the gate I was forced to go through several more rounds of security before boarding and waiting 2 hours for them to fix a problem. After that we waited an additional 50 minutes because of miscommunication between the pilot and air traffic control. Landed in Tokyo late and had to run to my connecting flight to make it on time. Tokyo flight was again delayed getting off the ground by almost an hour. Arrived late in Hawaii and had to run to my connecting flight to make it on board with minutes to spare. FAs were friendly and nice but staff involved in boarding are overly authoritative and rude. My flight to Thailand with United was also stressful full of delays and clumsy. They also regularly cancel fights with no notice.",sad
974,10975,United Airlines,4-Mar-14,Canada,5,First Class,2,NO,Worst travel experience ever. LHR-IAD-CLE 3 Jan 2014. I understand flights were cancelled due to weather but that's no excuse for the horrible United customer service on the phone at the gate on the aircraft and at the customer service counter. Everyone we talked to gave us a different answer which eventually lead to an additional 13 hours of travel. American or Delta will get my domestic and International business from here forward.,normal
975,10976,United Airlines,3-Mar-14,USA,9,First Class,1,NO,My first and undoubtedly last time flying United. The experience started out bad and then went downhill from there. On the first flight from Pittsburgh to Chicago we had to disembark before take-off because of a broken hydraulic the delay was a few hours and we barely made our connecting flight. The second flight Chicago to Nashville was delayed because the lavatory staff never showed up to empty the bathrooms. Our first flight home was delayed because of a broken intercom. The connecting flight home Chicago to Pittsburgh was supposed to take off at 1.28pm and arrive at destination at 3.49pm. We boarded the plane and waited for take off then were told to disembark because there was no flight crew. What they promised to be a short wait turned into six hours. Six hours of sitting at the gate with a $7 food voucher hoping a crew would eventually be found. The woman at the desk encouraged us to go to customer service but the employee at the end of that line told us the wait was too long and we should return to our gate. Unfortunately later flights to Pittsburgh were all booked to capacity. When a crew was finally found hours later they were greeted by us like celebrities. Once the crew was settled the passengers were boarded and the plane was de-iced the eventual take-off time was 7.30 six hours after it was supposed to. The only positive part about this flight was the kindness of the pilots and flight attendants. Their sweet attitudes and understanding were what kept us from completely melting down. United did offer us a discount for a future flight but it really isn't a fitting compensation for the huge inconvenience they caused us.,happy
976,10977,United Airlines,3-Mar-14,Canada,1,First Class,1,NO,"I was flying to South Dakota and on the way there United Airlines caused us to miss our connecting flight they made us check our bag at the gate but would not bring them up to the plane until the last possible minute and this was after sitting on the runway for 20 minutes with no explanation as to why. On our 5.40 am return flight we heard another passenger saying that her flight from Chicago to Atlanta had been canceled. We had received no notification no e-mails or anything notifying us that our connecting flight had been canceled. Put on the 7.00 flight. When we went to the gate (over an hour early) we watched as the flight changed times and gates multiple times when we finally thought everything was over and we were going to board soon I looked up at the standby screen and saw that the seat that was on my boarding pass had been given away. When I went up to the counter all I was told was that ""We have no record of your reservation someone else has your seats. Sorry"". We were sent from person to person at the counter. Told all they could do was put us on standby even though we had the boarding passes in our hands with the seat numbers. Finally able to get seats on the flight that was supposed to take off at 7.45 finally pulled out onto the runway at 9.45.

This time I had my teenager travelling with me - no on-demand entertainment and no tablets for hire made for a very unpleasant 19 hours - in seats that feel like an iron bench and staff that have learned 100 ways to say ""No"" and I can say with complete certainty I will never fly United again.",sad

980,10981,United Airlines,28-Feb-14,USA,3,Economy,5,NO,I used to fly United and Continental on a regular basis. The new seating and smaller bathrooms were horrible. We used frequent flyer points to travel and even with those will never fly this airline again. In fact we will pay twice as much just to not have to travel with them. I watched in horror as a father who took his baby into one of the newly configured bathrooms get stuck and unable to get out of the aforementioned bathroom. He had to put the baby on his shoulder and duck down to exit. This was not an exceptionally large man. The new pockets on the seat backs can't even hold a small book.

Single aisle aircraft is not a good idea on trans-atlantic routes. Moving around the plane was no so easy because of the single aisle. Had to pay for inflight drinks at about $7 a go.

We arrived at Louisville international Airport when they issued our tickets our seats were not together. We showed the counter help our booked flight and seats and she notified the supervisor who in turn changed our seats to be together.

986,10987,United Airlines,25-Feb-14,Canada,1,Economy,3,NO,Out of 5 flights none of which were on time. All were between a half an hour to a full hour late. My first three were to Alaska from New York with stops in D.C. and Denver. The result of these flights running late made it so I didn't have the time to stop and grab something to eat between planes. Not having a credit card the flight attendants would not allow me to purchase any food. The last of these late United-run planes was also veru unpleasant due to the screen being stuck on almost maximum brightness in front of my face the entire time I was trying to sleep because the armrest controls were not working. Arrived at the airport around the departure time of my connecting flight usually not a problem I've had airlines hold planes for me and others before but not this time.

However we were very disappointed about that lack of courtesy by the stewardess. Instead of asking: ""Would you like the chicken or beef meal Sir"" she simply shouted ""chicken or beef"" and then shoved the tray in our hands with a brisk ""here"". Also no printed menus were provided to show the meal choices on forehand. The fasten seatbelt signs were left on for two hours (with only slight turbulence). I got told off for going to the toilet but my girlfriend had to wait nearly a quarter of an hour before the stewardess let her through to the toilets (although she first asked permission). During all that time she was left standing in the aisle because the staff did not want to shift the coffee trolley back a couple of rows. During this time the seatbelt signs were still on and there was turbulence. Very inconsiderate and inconsistent! The inflight entertainment system on the flight to/from Costa Rica was horrible. We saw the same short ""B-quality"" movie about 8 time. We noticed that only about half a dozen other passengers paid the required US$ 7.99 to watch the direcTV programs.

989,10990,United Airlines,24-Feb-14,USA,3,Economy,1,NO,I booked a flight from Amarillo to Fargo with a connection in Denver. The flight was showing on time at the ticket counter. When I got to the gate the departure board showed the flight running 30 minutes late. I had a 3hr 45min. layover in Denver so I thought I was fine. The flight finally took off about 3 hrs late. When I got to Denver the board showed my flight to Fargo running 2 hrs late. After getting the run-around for 4 hrs from the United agents we finally boarded the plane to Fargo. After sitting on the runway for 45 minutes the pilot announced that they had to file a flight plan and it would be a few more minutes. 10 minutes later he announced that the crew was over their allowed hours for the day so they took us back to the gate and we went back into the terminal. There was no help from any of the agents. I had to be in Fargo the next morning so at considerable expense I booked a flight on Delta and got there the next day. Its a good thing I did because later that day I got a text message from United saying I was rebooked on a flight to Fargo for the next day which would have made me 2 days late on a 4 day trip.

All flights had the new seats which have relatively no padding at all. I am a small guy and average weight and I was so uncomfortable after 20 minutes.
